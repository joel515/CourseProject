# CS410 Course Project - CPLSA

## Background ##
This project attempts to duplicate the *Temporal-Author-Topic* analysis in section 4.1 of the paper [*A Mixture Model for Contextual Text Mining*](https://github.com/joel515/CourseProject/blob/main/kdd06-mix.pdf) by Qiaozhu Mei and ChengXiang Zhai.  This model replicates the **fixed-coverage contextual mixture model (FC-CPLSA)** covered in section 3.2 of the research paper.  The FC-CPLSA model is a specialized version of the CPLSA mixture model where the coverage over different contexts remains fixed.
