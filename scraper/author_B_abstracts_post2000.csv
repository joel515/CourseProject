1,"The problem of streaming data has gained importance in recent years because of advances in hardware technology. The ubiquitous presence of data streams in a number of practical domains has generated a lot of research in this area. Example applications include surveillance for terrorist attack, network monitoring for intrusion detection, and others. Problems such as data mining which have been widely studied for traditional data sets cannot be easily solved for the data stream domain. This is because the large volume of data arriving in a stream renders most algorithms to inefficient as most mining algorithms require multiple scans of data which is unrealistic for stream data. More importantly, the characteristics of the data stream can change over time and the evolving pattern needs to be captured. Furthermore, we also need to consider the problem of resource allocation in mining data streams. Due to the large volume and the high speed of streaming data, mining algorithms must cope with the effects of system overload. Thus, how to achieve optimum results under various resource constraints becomes a challenging task. In this talk, I'll provide an overview, discuss the issues and focus on how to mine evolving data streams and perform resource adaptive computation."
2,"In this report, we summarize the contents and outcomes of the recent WebKDD 2005 workshop on Web Mining and Web Usage Analysis that was held in conjunction with the 11th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2005), August 21-24, 2005, in Chicago, Illinois. The theme of this workshop was "Taming Evolving, Expanding and Multi-faceted Web Clickstreams". We also reflect on possible new directions in Web mining research as reflected by the discussions and the talks during the workshop."
3,"Graphs have become increasingly important in modelling complicated structures and schemaless data such as chemical compounds, proteins, and XML documents. Given a graph query, it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via indices. In this article, we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel indexing model based on discriminative frequent structures that are identified through a graph mining process. We show that the compact index built under this model can achieve better performance in processing graph queries. Since discriminative frequent structures capture the intrinsic characteristics of the data, they are relatively stable to database updates, thus facilitating sampling-based feature extraction and incremental index maintenance. Our approach not only provides an elegant solution to the graph indexing problem, but also demonstrates how database indexing and query processing can benefit from data mining, especially frequent pattern mining. Furthermore, the concepts developed here can be generalized and applied to indexing sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well."
4,"Efficient processing of continual range queries is important in providing location-aware mobile services. In this paper, we study a new main memory-based approach to indexing continual range queries to support location-aware mobile services. The query index is used to quickly answer the following question continually: "Which moving objects are currently located inside the boundaries of individual queries__ __" We present a  covering tile-based  (COVET) query index. A set of virtual tiles are predefined, each with a unique ID. One or more of the virtual tiles are used to strictly cover the region defined by an individual range query. The query ID is inserted into the ID lists associated with the covering tiles. These covering tiles touch each other only at the edges. A COVET index maintains a mapping between a covering tile and all the queries that contain that tile. For any object position, search is conducted indirectly via the covering tiles. More importantly, a COVET-based query index allows query evaluation to take advantage of incremental changes in object locations. Computation can be saved for those objects that have not moved outside the boundaries of covering tiles. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the COVET index and compare virtual tiles of different shapes and sizes."
5,"Data stream processing has become increasingly important as many emerging applications call for sophisticated realtime processing over data streams, such as stock trading surveillance, network traffic monitoring, and sensor data analysis. Stream joins are among the most important stream processing operations, which can be used to detect linkages and correlations between different data streams. One major challenge in processing stream joins is to handle continuous, high-volume, and time-varying data streams under resource constraints. In this paper, we present a novel load diffusion system to enable scalable execution of resource-intensive stream joins using an ensemble of server hosts. The load diffusion is achieved by a simple correlation-aware stream partition algorithm. Different from previous work, the load diffusion system can (1) achieve fine-grained load sharing in the distributed stream processing system; and (2) produce exact query answers without missing any join results or generate duplicate join results. Our experimental results show that the load diffusion scheme can greatly improve the system throughput and achieve more balanced load distribution."
6,"We present a new approach to community discovery. Community discovery usually partitions the graph into communities or clusters. Focused community discovery allows the searcher to specify start points of interest, and find the community of those points. Focused search allows for a much more scalable algorithm in which the time depends only on the size of the community, and not on the number of nodes in the graph, and so is scalable to arbitrarily large graphs. Furthermore, our algorithm is robust to imperfect data, such as extra or missing edges in the graph. We show the effectiveness of our algorithm using both synthetic graphs and on the real-life Livejournal friends graph, a publicly-available social network consisting of over two million users and 13 million edges."
7,"Mining ordering information from sequence data is an important data mining task. Sequential pattern mining [1] can be regarded as mining frequent segments of total orders from sequence data. However, sequential patterns are often insufficient to concisely capture the general ordering information."
8,"There has been increasing number of independently proposed randomization methods in different stages of decision tree construction to build multiple trees. Randomized decision tree methods have been reported to be significantly more accurate than widely-accepted single decision trees, although the training procedure of some methods incorporates a surprisingly random factor and therefore opposes the generally accepted idea of employing gain functions to choose optimum features at each node and compute a single tree that fits the data. One important question that is not well understood yet is the reason behind the high accuracy. We provide an insight based on posterior probability estimations. We first establish the relationship between effective posterior probability estimation and effective loss reduction. We argue that randomized decision tree methods effectively approximate the true probability distribution using the decision tree hypothesis space. We conduct experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets under both 0-1 and cost-sensitive loss functions."
9,"Combining multiple clusterings arises in various important data mining scenarios. However, finding a consensus clustering from multiple clusterings is a challenging task because there is no explicit correspondence between the classes from different clusterings. We present a new framework based on soft correspondence to directly address the correspondence problem in combining multiple clusterings. Under this framework, we propose a novel algorithm that iteratively computes the consensus clustering and correspondence matrices using multiplicative updating rules. This algorithm provides a final consensus clustering as well as correspondence matrices that gives intuitive interpretation of the relations between the consensus clustering and each clustering from clustering ensembles. Extensive experimental evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of this framework as well as the algorithm for discovering a consensus clustering from multiple clusterings."
10,"A recent paper categorizes classifier learning algorithms according to their sensitivity to a common type of sample selection bias where the chance of an example being selected into the training sample depends on its feature vector x but not (directly) on its class label y. A classifier learner is categorized as "local" if it is insensitive to this type of sample selection bias, otherwise, it is considered "global". In that paper, the true model is not clearly distinguished from the model that the algorithm outputs. In their discussion of Bayesian classifiers, logistic regression and hard-margin SVMs, the true model (or the model that generates the true class label for every example) is implicitly assumed to be contained in the model space of the learner, and the true class probabilities and model estimated class probabilities are assumed to asymptotically converge as the training data set size increases. However, in the discussion of naive Bayes, decision trees and soft-margin SVMs, the model space is assumed not to contain the true model, and these three algorithms are instead argued to be "global learners". We argue that most classifier learners may or may not be affected by sample selection bias; this depends on the dataset as well as the heuristics or inductive bias implied by the learning algorithm and their appropriateness to the particular dataset."
11,"Sharing data among organizations often leads to mutual benefit. Recent technology in data mining has enabled efficientextraction of knowledge from large databases. This, however, increases risks of disclosing the sensitive knowledge when the database is released to other parties. To address this privacy issue, one may sanitize the original database so that the sensitive knowledge is hidden. The challenge is to minimize the side effect on the quality of the sanitized database so that non-sensitive knowledge can still be mined. In this paper, we study such a problem in the context of hiding sensitive frequent itemsets by judiciously modifying the transactions in the database. To preserve the non-sensitive frequent itemsets, we propose a border-based approach to efficiently evaluate the impact of any modification to the database during the hiding process. The quality of database can be well maintained by greedily selecting the modifications with minimal side effect. Experiments results are also reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
12,"In this paper, we present a template-based privacy preservation to protect against the threats caused by data mining abilities. The problem has dual goals: preserve the information for a wanted classification analysis and limit the usefulness of unwanted sensitive inferences that may be derived from the data. Sensitive inferences are specified by a set of "privacy templates". Each template specifies the sensitive information to be protected, a set of identifying attributes, and the maximum association between the two. We show that suppressing the domain values is an effective way to eliminate sensitive inferences. For a large data set, finding an optimal suppression is hard, since it requires optimization over all suppressions. We present an approximate but scalable solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on real life data sets."
13,"Multi-party voice-over-IP (MVoIP) services provide economical and natural group communication mechanisms for many emerging applications such as on-line gaming, distance collaboration, and tele-immersion. In this paper, we present a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) stream processing system called peerTalk to provide resource-efficient and failure-resilient MVoIP services. Different from previous work, our solution is fully distributed and self-organizing without requiring specialized servers or IP multicast support. Particularly, we decouple the stream processing in MVoIP services into two phases: (1) aggregation phase that mixes audio streams from active speakers into a single stream; and (2) distribution phase that distributes the mixed audio stream to all listeners. The decoupled model allows us to optimize and adapt the P2P stream mixing and distribution processes separately. Specifically, we can adaptively spread stream mixing workload among resource-constrained peer hosts according to current speaking activities. We have implemented a prototype of the peerTalk system and conducted experiments in real-world wide-area networks. The results show that peerTalk can achieve lower resource contention and better service quality than previous common solution."
14,"Data stream processing has become increasingly important as many emerging applications call for sophisticated realtime processing over data streams, such as stock trading surveillance, network traffic monitoring, and sensor data analysis. Stream joins are among the most important stream processing operations, which can be used to detect linkages and correlations between different data streams. One major challenge in processing stream joins is to handle continuous, high-volume, and time-varying data streams under resource constraints.

15,"Testing reachability between nodes in a graph is a well-known problem with many important applications, including knowledge representation, program analysis, and more recently, biological and ontology databases inferencing as well as XML query processing. Various approaches have been proposed to encode graph reachability information using node labeling schemes, but most existing schemes only work well for specific types of graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, HLSS(Hierarchical Labeling of Sub-Structures), which identifies different types of substructures within a graph and encodes them using techniques suitable to the characteristics of each of them. We implement HLSS with an efficient two-phase algorithm, where the first phase identifies and encodes strongly connected components as well as tree substructures, and the second phase encodes the remaining reachability relationships by compressing dense rectangular submatrices in the transitive closure matrix. For the important subproblem of finding densest submatrices, we demonstrate the hardness of the problem and propose several practical algorithms. Experiments show that HLSS handles different types of graphs well, while existing approaches fall prey to graphs with substructures they are not designed to handle."
16,"For time-relevant multi-dimensional data sets (MDS), users usually pose a huge amount of data due to the large dimensionality, and approximating query processing has emerged as a viable solution. Specifically, the cube streams handle MDSs in a continuous manner. Traditional cube approximation focuses on generating single snapshots rather than continuous ones. To address this issue, the application of generating snapshots for cube streams, called SCS, is investigated in this paper. Such an application collects data events for cube streams on-line and generates snapshots with limited resources in order to keep the approximated information in synopsis memory for further analysis. As compared to OLAP applications, the SCS ones are subject to much more resource constraints for both processing time and memory and cannot be dealt with by existing methods due to the limited resources. In this paper, the DAWA algorithm, standing for a hybrid algorithm of Dct for Data and discrete WAvelet transform, is proposed to approximate the cube streams. The DAWA algorithm combines the advantage of high compression rate from DWT and that of low memory cost from DCT. Consequently, DAWA costs much smaller working buffer and outperforms both DWT-based and DCT-based methods in execution efficiency. Also, it is shown that DAWA provides answers of good quality for SCS applications with a small working buffer and short execution time. The optimality of algorithm DAWA is theoretically proved and also empirically demonstrated by our experiments."
17,"We present an adaptive load shedding approach for windowed stream joins. In contrast to the conventional approach of dropping tuples from the input streams, we explore the concept of selective processing for load shedding. We allow stream tuples to be stored in the windows and shed excessive CPU load by performing the join operations, not on the entire set of tuples within the windows, but on a dynamically changing subset of tuples that are learned to be highly beneficial. We support such dynamic selective processing through three forms of runtime adaptations: adaptation to input stream rates, adaptation to time correlation between the streams and adaptation to join directions. Indexes are used to further speed up the execution of stream joins. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our adaptive load shedding in terms of output rate. The results show that our selective processing approach to load shedding is very effective and significantly outperforms the approach that drops tuples from the input streams."
18,"We present data representations, distance measures and organizational structures for fast and efficient retrieval of similar shapes in image databases. Using the Hough Transform we extract shape signatures that correspond to important features of an image. The new shape descriptor is robust against line discontinuities and takes into consideration not only the shape boundaries, but also the content inside the object perimeter. The object signatures are eventually projected into a space that renders them invariant to translation, scaling and rotation. In order to provide support for real-time query-by-content, we also introduce an index structure that hierarchically organizes compressed versions of the extracted object signatures. In this manner we can achieve a significant performance boost for multimedia retrieval. Our experiments suggest that by exploiting the proposed framework, similarity search in a database of 100,000 images would require under 1 sec, using an off-the-shelf personal computer."
19,"We examine the problem of monitoring and identification of correlated burst patterns in multi-stream time series databases. Our methodology is comprised of two steps: a burst detection part, followed by a burst indexing step. The burst detection scheme imposes a variable threshold on the examined data and takes advantage of the skewed distribution that is typically encountered in many applications. The indexing step utilizes a memory-based interval index for effectively identifying the overlapping burst regions. While the focus of this work is on financial data, the proposed methods and data-structures can find applications for anomaly or novelty detection in telecommunications and network traffic, as well as in medical data. Finally, we manifest the real-time response of our burst indexing technique, and demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for correlating surprising volume trading events at the NY stock exchange."
20,"In many classification and data-mining applications the user does not know a priori which distance measure is the most appropriate for the task at hand without examining the produced results. Also, in several cases, different distance functions can provide diverse but equally intuitive results (according to the specific focus of each measure). In order to address the above issues, we elaborate on the construction of a hybrid index structure that supports query-by-example on shape and structural distance measures, therefore lending enhanced exploratory power to the system user. The shape distance measure that the index supports is the ubiquitous Euclidean distance, while the structural distance measure that we utilize is based on important periodic features extracted from a sequence. This new measure is phase-invariant and can provide flexible sequence characterizations, loosely resembling the Dynamic Time Warping, requiring only a fraction of the computational cost of the latter. Exploiting the relationship between the Euclidean and periodic measure, the new hybrid index allows for powerful query processing, enabling the efficient answering of kNN queries on both measures in a single index scan. We envision that our system can provide a basis for fast tracking of correlated time-delayed events, with applications in data visualization, financial market analysis, machine monitoring/diagnostics and gene expression data analysis."
21,"The most well known search techniques are perhaps the PageRank and HITS algorithms. In this paper we argue that these algorithms miss an important dimension, the temporal dimension. Quality pages in the past may not be quality pages now or in the future. These techniques favor older pages because these pages have many in-links accumulated over time. New pages, which may be of high quality, have few or no in-links and are left behind. Research publication search has the same problem. If we use the PageRank or HITS algorithm, those older or classic papers will be ranked high due to the large number of citations that they received in the past. This paper studies the temporal dimension of search in the context of research publication. A number of methods are proposed to deal with the problem based on analyzing the behavior history and the source of each publication. These methods are evaluated empirically. Our results show that they are highly effective."
22,"In this demo, we show that intelligent load shedding is essential in achieving optimum results in mining data streams under various resource constraints. The Loadstar system introduces load shedding techniques to classifying multiple data streams of large volume and high speed. Loadstar uses a novel metric known as the quality of decision (QoD) to measure the level of uncertainty in classification. Resources are then allocated to sources where uncertainty is high. To make optimum classification decisions and accurate QoD measurement, Loadstar relies on feature prediction to model the data dropped by the load shedding mechanism. Furthermore, Loadstar is able to adapt to the changing data characteristics in data streams. The system thus offers a nice solution to data mining with resource constraints."
23,"Text classification is a major data mining task. An advanced text classification technique is known as partially supervised text classification, which can build a text classifier using a small set of positive examples only. This leads to our curiosity whether it is possible to find a set of features that can be used to describe the positive examples. Therefore, users do not even need to specify a set of positive examples. As the first step, in this paper, we formalize it as a new problem, called hot bursty events detection, to detect bursty events from a text stream which is a sequence of chronologically ordered documents. Here, a bursty event is a set of bursty features, and is considered as a potential category to build a text classifier. It is important to know that the hot bursty events detection problem, we study in this paper, is different from TDT (topic detection and tracking) which attempts to cluster documents as events using clustering techniques. In other words, our focus is on detecting a set of bursty features for a bursty event. In this paper, we propose a new novel parameter free probabilistic approach, called feature-pivot clustering. Our main technique is to fully utilize the time information to determine a set of bursty features which may occur in differenttime windows. We detect bursty events based on the feature distributions. There is no need to tune or estimate any parameters. We conduct experiments using real life data, a major English newspaper in Hong Kong, and show that the parameter free feature-pivot clustering approach can detect the bursty events with a high success rate."
24,"One fundamental task in near-neighbor search as well as other similarity matching efforts is to find a distance function that can efficiently quantify the similarity between two objects in a meaningful way. In DNA microarray analysis, the expression levels of two closely related genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of experimental stimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close, the patterns they exhibit can be very similar. Unfortunately, none of the conventional distance metrics such as the Lp norm can model this similarity effectively. In this paper, we study the near-neighbor search problem based on this new type of similarity. We propose to measure the distance between two genes by subspace pattern similarity, i.e., whether they exhibit a synchronous pattern of rise and fall on a subset of dimensions. We then present an efficient algorithm for subspace near-neighbor search based on pattern similarity distance, and we perform tests on various data sets to show its effectiveness."
25,"Dyadic data matrices, such as co-occurrence matrix, rating matrix, and proximity matrix, arise frequently in various important applications. A fundamental problem in dyadic data analysis is to find the hidden block structure of the data matrix. In this paper, we present a new co-clustering framework, block value decomposition(BVD), for dyadic data, which factorizes the dyadic data matrix into three components, the row-coefficient matrix R, the block value matrix B, and the column-coefficient matrix C. Under this framework, we focus on a special yet very popular case -- non-negative dyadic data, and propose a specific novel co-clustering algorithm that iteratively computes the three decomposition matrices based on the multiplicative updating rules. Extensive experimental evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of this framework as well as the specific algorithms for co-clustering, and in particular, for discovering the hidden block structure in the dyadic data."
26,"Clustering is an essential data mining task with numerous applications. However, data in most real-life applications are high-dimensional in nature, and the related information often spreads across multiple relations. To ensure effective and efficient high-dimensional, cross-relational clustering, we propose a new approach, called CrossClus, which performs cross-relational clustering with user's guidance. We believe that user's guidance, even likely in very simple forms, could be essential for effective high-dimensional clustering since a user knows well the application requirements and data semantics. CrossClus is carried out as follows: A user specifies a clustering task and selects one or a small set of features pertinent to the task. CrossClus extracts the set of highly relevant features in multiple relations connected via linkages defined in the database schema, evaluates their effectiveness based on user's guidance, and identifies interesting clusters that fit user's needs. This method takes care of both quality in feature extraction and efficiency in clustering. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this approach."
27,"In recent years, data streams have become ubiquitous in a variety of applications because of advances in hardware technology. Since data streams may be generated by applications which are time-changing in nature, it is often desirable to explore the underlying changing trends in the data. In this paper, we will explore and survey some of our recent methods for change detection. In particular, we will study methods for change detection which use clustering in order to provide a concise understanding of the underlying trends. We discuss our recent techniques which use micro-clustering in order to diagnose the changes in the underlying data. We also discuss the extension of this method to text and categorical data sets as well community detection in graph data streams."
28,"A set of continual range queries, each defining the geographical region of interest, can be periodically reevaluated to locate moving objects. Processing these continual queries efficiently and incrementally hence becomes important for location-aware services and applications. In this paper, we study a new query indexing method, called CES-based indexing, for incremental processing of continual range queries over moving objects. A set of containment-encoded squares (CES) are prede__ __ned, each with a unique ID. CES s are virtual constructs (VC) used to decompose query regions and to store indirectly precomputed search results. Compared with a prior VC-based approach, the number of VC s visited in an index search in CES-based indexing is reduced from (4L2 - 1)/3 to log(L) + 1, where L is the maximal side length of a VC. Search time is hence significantly lowered. Moreover, containment encoding among the CES s makes it easy to identify all those VC s that need not be visited during an incremental query reevaluation. We study the performance of CES-based indexing and compare it with a prior VC-based approach."
29,"Frequent itemset mining aims at discovering patterns the supports of which are beyond a given threshold. In many applications, including network event management systems, which motivated this work, patterns are composed of items each described by a subset of attributes of a relational table. As it involves an exponential mining space, the efficient implementation of user preferences and mining constraints becomes the first priority for a mining algorithm. User preferences and mining constraints are often expressed using patterns' attribute structures. Unlike traditional methods that mine all frequent patterns indiscriminately, we regard frequent itemset mining as a two-step process: the mining of the pattern structures and the mining of patterns within each pattern structure. In this paper, we present a novel architecture that uses pattern structures to organize the mining space. In comparison with the previous techniques, the advantage of our approach is two-fold: (i) by exploiting the interrelationships among pattern structures, execution times for mining can be reduced significantly; and (ii) more importantly, it enables us to incorporate high-level simple user preferences and mining constraints into the mining process efficiently. These advantages are demonstrated by our experiments using both synthetic and real-life datasets."
30,"Advanced database systems face a great challenge raised by the emergence of massive, complex structural data in bioinformatics, chem-informatics, and many other applications. The most fundamental support needed in these applications is the efficient search of complex structured data. Since exact matching is often too restrictive, similarity search of complex structures becomes a vital operation that must be supported efficiently.In this paper, we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed missing features, our structural filtering algorithm, called Grafil, can filter many graphs without performing pairwise similarity computations. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature set selection strategy for filtering. By examining the effect of different feature selection mechanisms, we develop a multi-filter composition strategy, where each filter uses a distinct and complementary subset of the features. We identify the criteria to form effective feature sets for filtering, and demonstrate that combining features with similar size and selectivity can improve the filtering and search performance significantly. Moreover, the concept presented in Grafil can be applied to searching approximate non-consecutive sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well."
31,"Stream processing has become increasingly important with emergence of stream applications such as audio/video surveillance, stock price tracing, and sensor data analysis. A challenging problem is to provide optimal component composition in a distributed stream processing environment. The goal of optimal component composition is to achieve load balancing subject to multiple function, resource, and quality-of-service (QoS) constraints while composing stream applications. In this paper, we present an adaptive composition probing (ACP) approach to the problem. Different from previous work, ACP provides a new hybrid approach that combines distributed composition probing with coarse-grain global state management. Guided by the coarse-grain global state information, ACP selectively probes a subset of candidate components to discover an approximately optimal component composition. Further, ACP is self-tuning, which can adaptively adjust the number of probes to maintain a specified composition performance target (i.e., composition success rate) in a dynamic stream environment. While the optimal component composition problem is NP-hard, our ACP approach provides an adaptive polynomial approximation solution. We have conducted extensive simulation experiments to show the efficiency, scalability, and adaptability of the ACP approach by comparing with other alternative solutions."
32,"Previous work on structural joins mostly focuses on maintaining offline indexes on disks. Most of them also require the elements in both sets to be sorted. In this paper, we study an on-the-fly, in-memory indexing approach to structural joins. There is no need to sort the elements or maintain indexes on disks. We identify the similarity between the structural join problem and the stabbing query problem, and extend a main memory-based indexing technique for stabbing queries to structural joins."
33,"The problem of data streams has gained importance in recent years because of advances in hardware technology. These advances have made it easy to store and record numerous transactions and activities in everyday life in an automated way. The ubiquitous presence of data streams in a number of practical domains has generated a lot of research in this area. Example applications include trade surveillance for security fraud and money laundering, network monitoring for intrusion detection, bio-surveillance for terrorist attack, and others. Data is viewed as a continuous stream in this kind of applications. Problems such as data mining which have been widely studied for traditional data sets cannot be easily solved for the data stream domain. This is because the large volume of data arriving in a stream renders most algorithms to inefficient as most mining algorithms require multiple scans of data which is unrealistic for stream data. More importantly, the characteristics of the data stream can change over time and the evolving pattern needs to be captured. Furthermore, we need to consider the problem of resource allocation in mining data streams. Due to the large volume and the high speed of streaming data, mining algorithms must cope with the effects of system overload. Thus, how to achieve optimum results under various resource constraints becomes a challenging task. In this talk, I'll provide an overview, discuss the issues and focus on how to mine evolving data streams and perform resource adaptive computation."
34,"Releasing person-specific data in its most specific state poses a threat to individual privacy. This paper presents a practical and efficient algorithm for determining a generalized version of data that masks sensitive information and remains useful for modelling classification. The generalization of data is implemented by specializing or detailing the level of information in a top-down manner until a minimum privacy requirement is violated. This top-down specialization is natural and efficient for handling both categorical and continuous attributes. Our approach exploits the fact that data usually contains redundant structures forclassification. While generalization may eliminate some structures, other structures emerge to help. Our results show that quality of classification can be preserved even for highly restrictive privacy requirements. This work has great applicability to both public and private sectors that share information for mutual benefits and productivity."
35,"This paper presents a new solution for the problem of building a text classifier with a small set of labeled positive documents (P) and a large set of unlabeled documents (U). Here, the unlabeled documents are mixed with both of the positive and negative documents. In other words, no document is labeled as negative. This makes the task of building a reliable text classifier challenging. In general, the existing approaches for solving this kind of problem use a two-step approach: i) extract the negative documents (N) from U; and ii) build a classifier based on P and N. However, none of the reported studies tries to further extract any positive documents (P ) from U. Intuitively, extracting P from U will increase the reliability of the classifier. However, extracting P from U is difficult. A document in U that possesses some of the features exhibited in P does not necessarily mean that it is a positive document, and vice versa. It is very sensitive to extract positive documents, because those extracted positive samples may become noises. The very large size of U and the very high diversity exhibited there also contribute to the difficulty of extracting any positive documents. In this paper, we propose a partitionbased heuristic which aims at extracting both of the positive and negative documents in U. Extensive experiments based on three benchmarks are conducted. The favorable results indicated that our proposed heuristic outperforms all of the existing approaches significantly, especially in the case where the size of P is extremely small."
36,"The complexity of services provided through the Web is continuously increasing as well as the variety of new devices that are gaining access to the Internet. Tailoring Web and multimedia resources to meet the user and client requirements opens two main novel issues in the research area of content delivery. The working set tends to increase sub-stantially because multiple versions may be generated from the same original resource. Moreover, the content adaptation operations may be computationally expensive. In this paper, we consider third-party infrastructures composed by a geographically distributed system of intermediary and cooperative nodes that provide fast content adaptation and delivery of Web resources. We propose a novel distributed architecture of intermediary nodes which are organized in two levels. The front-end nodes in the first tier are thin edge servers that locate the resources and forward the client requests to the nodes in the second tier. These interior nodes are fat servers that run the most expensive functions such as content adaptation, resource caching and fetching. Through real prototypes we compare the performance of the proposed two-level architecture to that of alternative one-level infrastructures where all nodes are fat peers providing the entire set of functions."
37,"This paper describes a <i>motion adaptive</i> indexing scheme for efficient evaluation of moving continual queries (MCQs) over moving objects. It uses the concept of <i>motion-sensitive bounding boxes</i> (<i>MSB</i>s) to model moving objects and moving queries. These bounding boxes automatically adapt their sizes to the dynamic motion behaviors of individual objects. Instead of indexing frequently changing object positions, we index less frequently changing object and query <i>MSB</i>s, where updates to the bounding boxes are needed only when objects and queries move across the boundaries of their boxes. This helps decrease the number of updates to the indexes. More importantly, we use <i>predictive query results</i> to optimistically precalculate query results, decreasing the number of searches on the indexes. Motion-sensitive bounding boxes are used to incrementally update the predictive query results. Our experiments show that the proposed motion adaptive indexing scheme is efficient for the evaluation of moving continual range queries."
38,"A large number of continual range queries can be issued against a data stream. Usually, a main memory-based query index with a small storage cost and a fast search time is needed, especially if the stream is rapid. In this paper, we present a CEI-based query index that meets both criteria for efficient processing of continual interval queries in a streaming environment. This new query index is centered around a set of predefined virtual <i>containment-encoded intervals</i>, or CEIs. The CEIs are used to first decompose query intervals and then perform efficient search operations. The CEIs are defined and labeled such that containment relationships among them are encoded in their IDs. The containment encoding makes decomposition and search operations efficient because integer additions and logical shifts can be used to carry out most of the operations. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the CEI-based query index and to compare it with alternative approaches. The results show that the CEI-based query index significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both storage cost and search time."
39,"Most previously proposed mining methods on data streams make an unrealistic assumption that "labelled" data stream is readily available and can be mined at anytime. However, in most real-world problems, labelled data streams are rarely immediately available. Due to this reason, models are reconstructed only when labelled data become available periodically. This passive stream mining model has several drawbacks. We propose a new concept of demand-driven active data mining. In active mining, the loss of the model is either continuously guessed without using any true class labels or estimated, whenever necessary, from a small number of instances whose actual class labels are verified by paying an affordable cost. When the estimated loss is more than a tolerable threshold, the model evolves by using a small number of instances with verified true class labels. Previous work on active mining concentrates on error guess and estimation. In this paper, we discuss several approaches on decision tree evolution."
40,"The well-known privacy-preserved data mining modifies existing data mining techniques to randomized data. In this paper, we investigate data mining as a technique for masking data, therefore, termed data mining based privacy protection. This approach incorporates partially the requirement of a targeted data mining task into the process of masking data so that essential structure is preserved in the masked data. The idea is simple but novel: we explore the data generalization concept from data mining as a way to hide detailed information, rather than discover trends and patterns. Once the data is masked, standard data mining techniques can be applied without modification. Our work demonstrated another positive use of data mining technology: not only can it discover useful patterns, but also mask private information. We consider the following privacy problem: a data holder wants to release a version of datafor building classification models, but wants to protect against linking the released data to an external source for inferring sensitive information. We adapt an iterative bottom-up generalization from data mining to generalize the data. The generalized data remains useful to classification but becomes difficult to link to other sources. The generalization space is specified by a hierarchical structure of generalizations. A key is identifying the best generalization to climb up the hierarchy at each iteration. Enumerating all candidate generalizations is impractical. We present a scalable solution that examines at most one generalization in each iteration for each attribute involved in the linking."
41,"This paper considers the problem of mining closed frequent itemsets over a sliding window using limited memory space. We design a synopsis data structure to monitor transactions in the sliding window so that we can output the current closed frequent itemsets at any time. Due to time and memory constraints, the synopsis data structure cannot monitor all possible itemsets. However, monitoring only frequent itemsets will make it impossible to detect new itemsets when they become frequent. In this paper, we introduce a compact data structure, the closed enumeration tree (CET), to maintain a dynamically selected set of itemsets over a sliding-window. The selected itemsets consist of a boundary between closed frequent itemsets and the rest of the itemsets. Concept drifts in a data stream are reflected by boundary movements in the CET. In other words, a status change of any itemset (e.g., from non-frequent to frequent) must occur through the boundary. Because the boundary is relatively stable, the cost of mining closed frequent itemsets over a sliding window is dramatically reduced to that of mining transactions that can possibly cause boundary movements in the CET. Our experiments show that our algorithm performs much better than previous approaches."
42,"Peer-to-peer file sharing networks have emerged as a new popular application in the Internet scenario. In this paper, we provide an analytical model of the resources size and of the contents shared at a given node.We also study the composition of the content workload hosted in the Gnutella network over time. Finally, we investigate the negative impact of oversimplified hypotheses (e.g., the use of filenames as resource identifiers) on the potentially achievable hit rate of a file sharing cache. The message coming out of our findings is clear: file sharing traffic can be reduced by using a cache to minimize download time and network usage. The design and tuning of the cache server should take into account the presence of different resources sharing the same name and should consider push-based downloads. Failing to do so can result in reduced effectiveness of the caching mechanism."
43,"Proxy caching of large multimedia objects on the edge of the Internet has become increasingly important for reducing network latency. For a large media object, such as a two-hour video, treating the whole media as a single object for caching is not appropriate. In this paper, we study three media segmentation approaches to proxy caching: fixed, pyramid, and skyscraper. Blocks of a media stream are grouped into various segments for cache management. The cache admission and replacement policies attach different caching priorities to individual segments, taking into account the access frequency of the media object and the segment distance from the start of the media. These caching policies give preferential treatment to the beginning segments. As such, most user requests can be quickly played back from the proxy servers without delay. Event-driven simulations are conducted to evaluate the segmentation approaches and compare them with whole media caching. The results show that: 1) compared with whole media caching, segmentation-based caching is more effective not only in increased byte-hit ratio but also in lowered fraction of requests that requires delayed start; 2) pyramid segmentation, where segment size increases exponentially, is the best segmentation approach; and 3) segmentation-based caching is especially advantageous when the cache size is limited, when the set of hot media objects changes over time, when the media file size is large, and when there are a large number of distinct media objects."
44,"This paper presents a dynamic interval index for fast event matching against a large number of predicate intervals specified by content-based subscriptions. A set of virtual construct intervals (VCIs) is predefined, each with a unique ID and an associated ID list. Each predicate interval is decomposed into one or more VCIs, which become activated by the predicate. The predicate ID is then inserted into the ID lists associated with the decomposed VCIs. To facilitate fast search, we start with a bitmap vector to indicate the activation of VCIs that cover an attribute value. Then, we study various techniques to reduce the storage cost, including logarithmic construct intervals (LCI) which reduce the total number of VCIs, bitmap clipping which prunes certain positions of a bitmap vector, and bitmap virtualization which eliminates the bitmap. Simulations are conducted to evaluate and compare these techniques."
45,"In this paper, we focus on mining surprising periodic patterns in a sequence of events. In many applications, e.g., computational biology, an infrequent pattern is still considered very significant if its actual occurrence frequency exceeds the prior expectation by a large margin. The traditional metric, such as support, is not necessarily the ideal model to measure this kind of surprising patterns because it treats all patterns equally in the sense that every occurrence carries the same weight towards the assessment of the significance of a pattern regardless of the probability of occurrence. A more suitable measurement, information, is introduced to naturally value the degree of surprise of each occurrence of a pattern as a continuous and monotonically decreasing function of its probability of occurrence. This would allow patterns with vastly different occurrence probabilities to be handled seamlessly. As the accumulated degree of surprise of all repetitions of a pattern, the concept of information gain is proposed to measure the overall degree of surprise of the pattern within a data sequence. The bounded information gain property is identified to tackle the predicament caused by the violation of the downward closure property by the information gain measure and in turn provides an efficient solution to this problem. Furthermore, the user has a choice between specifying a minimum information gain threshold and choosing the number of surprising patterns wanted. Empirical tests demonstrate the efficiency and the usefulness of the proposed model."
46,"The data stream problem has been studied extensively in recent years, because of the great ease in collection of stream data. The nature of stream data makes it essential to use algorithms which require only one pass over the data. Recently, single-scan, stream analysis methods have been proposed in this context. However, a lot of stream data is high-dimensional in nature. High-dimensional data is inherently more complex in clustering, classification, and similarity search. Recent research discusses methods for projected clustering over high-dimensional data sets. This method is however difficult to generalize to data streams because of the complexity of the method and the large volume of the data streams."
47,"Current models of the classification problem do not effectively handle bursts of particular classes coming in at different times. In fact, the current model of the classification problem simply concentrates on methods for one-pass classification modeling of very large data sets. Our model for data stream classification views the data stream classification problem from the point of view of a dynamic approach in which simultaneous training and testing streams are used for dynamic classification of data sets. This model reflects real life situations effectively, since it is desirable to classify test streams in real time over an evolving training and test stream. The aim here is to create a classification system in which the training model can adapt quickly to the changes of the underlying data stream. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an on-demand classification process which can dynamically select the appropriate window of past training data to build the classifier. The empirical results indicate that the system maintains a high classification accuracy in an evolving data stream, while providing an efficient solution to the classification task."
48,"Traditionally, text classifiers are built from labeled training examples. Labeling is usually done manually by human experts (or the users), which is a labor intensive and time consuming process. In the past few years, researchers investigated various forms of semi-supervised learning to reduce the burden of manual labeling. In this paper, we propose a different approach. Instead of labeling a set of documents, the proposed method labels a set of representative words for each class. It then uses these words to extract a set of documents for each class from a set of unlabeled documents to form the initial training set. The EM algorithm is then applied to build the classifier. The key issue of the approach is how to obtain a set of representative words for each class. One way is to ask the user to provide them, which is difficult because the user usually can only give a few words (which are insufficient for accurate learning). We propose a method to solve the problem. It combines clustering and feature selection. The technique can effectively rank the words in the unlabeled set according to their importance. The user then selects/labels some words from the ranked list for each class. This process requires less effort than providing words with no help or manual labelillg of documents. Our results show that the new method is highly effective and promising."
49,"We present a shingle-based query index (SQI) for supporting location-based services in mobile e-commerce. SQI is used to efficiently identify moving objects that are currently located inside a geographical region. A set of virtual shingles is predefined, each with a unique ID. One or more shingles are used to cover the geographical region defined by a range query, where the covering shingles may overlap with one another. SQI maintains a direct mapping from individual shingles to the range queries that contain them. The use of covering shingles has two important properties. First, it does not impose any limit on the object moving speed or direction. Second, it allows the reevaluation of continual range queries to capitalize on the incremental changes in object locations. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of SQI and compare it with a cell-based approach."
50,"In this paper, we study the problem on how to build an index structurefor large string databases to efficiently support various types ofstring matching without the necessity of mapping the substrings toa numerical space (e.g., string B-tree and MRS-index) nor the restrictionof in-memory practice (e.g., suffix tree and suffix array).Towards this goal, we propose a new indexing scheme, BASS-tree,to efficiently support general approximate substring match (in termsof certain symbol substitutions and misalignments) in sublinear timeon a large string database. The key idea behind the design is that allpositions in each string are grouped recursively into a fully balancedtree according to the similarities of the subsequent segments startingat those positions. Each node is labeled with a regular expressionthat describes the commonality of the substrings indexed through thesubtree. Any search can then be properly directed to the portionin the database with a high potential of matching quickly. With theBASS-tree in place, wild card(s) in the query pattern can also behandled in a seamless way. In addition, search of a long pattern canbe decomposed into a series of searches of short segments followedby a process to join the results. It has been demonstrated in ourexperiments that the potential performance improvement brought byBASS-tree is in an order of magnitude over alternative methods."
51,"Unlike traditional clustering methods that focus ongrouping objects with similar values on a set of dimensions,clustering by pattern similarity finds objects thatexhibit a coherent pattern of rise and fall in subspaces.Pattern-based clustering extends the concept of traditional clustering and bene ts a wide range of applications, including large scale scientific data analysis, targetmarketing, web usage analysis, etc. However, state-of-the-art pattern-based clustering methods (e.g., the pCluster algorithm) can only handle datasets of thousands ofrecords, which makes them inappropriate for many real-life applications. Furthermore, besides the huge data volume, many data sets are also characterized by their sequentiality, for instance, customer purchase records andnetwork event logs are usually modeled as data sequences.Hence, it becomes important to enable pattern-based clustering methods i) to handle large datasets, and ii) to discover pattern similarity embedded in data sequences.In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that offersthis capability. Experimental results from both real lifeand synthetic datasets prove its effectiveness and efficiency."
52,"Graph has become increasingly important in modelling complicated structures and schemaless data such as proteins, chemical compounds, and XML documents. Given a graph query, it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via graph-based indices. In this paper, we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel solution by applying a graph mining technique. Different from the existing path-based methods, our approach, called gIndex, makes use of frequent substructure as the basic indexing feature. Frequent substructures are ideal candidates since they explore the intrinsic characteristics of the data and are relatively stable to database updates. To reduce the size of index structure, two techniques, size-increasing support constraint and discriminative fragments, are introduced. Our performance study shows that gIndex has 10 times smaller index size, but achieves 3--10 times better performance in comparison with a typical path-based method, GraphGrep. The gIndex approach not only provides and elegant solution to the graph indexing problem, but also demonstrates how database indexing and query processing can benefit form data mining, especially frequent pattern mining. Furthermore, the concepts developed here can be applied to indexing sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well."
53,"Web search is probably the single most important application on the Internet. The most famous search techniques are perhaps the PageRank and HITS algorithms. These algorithms are motivated by the observation that a hyperlink from a page to another is an implicit conveyance of authority to the target page. They exploit this social phenomenon to identify quality pages, e.g., "authority" pages and "hub" pages. In this paper we argue that these algorithms miss an important dimension of the Web, the temporal dimension. The Web is not a static environment. It changes constantly. Quality pages in the past may not be quality pages now or in the future. These techniques favor older pages because these pages have many in-links accumulated over time. New pages, which may be of high quality, have few or no in-links and are left behind. Bringing new and quality pages to users is important because most users want the latest information. Research publication search has exactly the same problem. This paper studies the temporal dimension of search in the context of research publication search. We propose a number of methods deal with the problem. Our experimental results show that these methods are highly effective."
54,"Most of today's structured data is stored in relationaldatabases. Such a database consists of multiplerelations which are linked together conceptually viaentity-relationship links in the design of relational databaseschemas. Multi-relational classification can be widelyused in many disciplines, such as financial decision making,medical research, and geographical applications.However, most classification approaches only work on single"flat" data relations. It is usually difficult to convertmultiple relations into a single flat relation without eitherintroducing huge, undesirable "universal relation" orlosing essential information. Previous works using InductiveLogic Programming approaches (recently also knownas Relational Mining) have proven effective with high accuracyin multi-relational classification.

55,"We study a new main memory-based approach to indexingcontinual range queries to support location-awaremobile services. The query index is used to efficiently answerthe following question repeatedly: "Which moving objectsare currently located inside the boundaries of individualqueries?" We present a covering tile-based (COVET)query index, where adjacent covering tiles touch each otheronly at the edges. A set of virtual tiles are predefined, eachwith a unique ID. One or more of the virtual tiles are usedto strictly cover individual range queries. A COVET indexmaintains a direct mapping between covering tiles andqueries. It allows query evaluation to take advantage of incrementalchanges in object locations.

57,"Fast matching of events against a large number of range predicates is important for many applications. We present a novel VCR indexing scheme for highly-overlapping 2D range predicates. VCR stands for virtual construct rectangle. Each predicate is decomposed into one or more VCRs, which are then considered to be activated. The predicate ID is then stored in the ID lists associated with these activated VCRs. Event matching is conceptually simple. For each event point, the search result is stored in the ID lists associated with the activated VCRs that cover the event point. However, it is computationally nontrivial to identify the activated covering VCRs. We define a covering VCR set for each event point and present an algorithm for fast event matching. Simulations are conducted to study the performance of VCR indexing."

59,"In this paper, we extend the traditional association rule problem by allowing a weight to be associated with each item in a transaction to reflect the interest/intensity of each item within the transaction. In turn, this provides us with an opportunity to associate a weight parameter with each item in a resulting association rule; we call them weighted association rules (WAR). One example of such a rule might be 80% of people buying more than three bottles of soda will also be likely to buy more than four packages of snack food, while a conventional association rule might just be 60% of people buying soda will be also be likely to buy snack food. Thus WARs cannot only improve the confidence of the rules, but also provide a mechanism to do more effective target marketing by identifying or segmenting customers based on their potential degree of loyalty or volume of purchases. Our approach mines WARs by first ignoring the weight and finding the frequent itemsets (via a traditional frequent itemset discovery algorithm), followed by introducing the weight during the rule generation. Specifically, the rule generation is achieved by partitioning the weight domain space of each frequent itemset into fine grids, and then identifying the popular regions within the domain space to derive WARs. This approach does not only support the batch mode mining, i.e., finding WARs for the dataset, but also supports the interactive mode, i.e., finding and refining WARs for a given (set) of frequent itemset(s)."
60,"Abstract--In this paper, we discuss the merits of building text categorization systems by using supervised clustering techniques. Traditional approaches for document classification on a predefined set of classes are often unable to provide sufficient accuracy because of the difficulty of fitting a manually categorized collection of documents in a given classification model. This is especially the case for heterogeneous collections of Web documents which have varying styles, vocabulary, and authorship. Hence, this paper investigates the use of clustering in order to create the set of categories and its use for classification of documents. Completely unsupervised clustering has the disadvantage that it has difficulty in isolating sufficiently fine-grained classes of documents relating to a coherent subject matter. In this paper, we use the information from a preexisting taxonomy in order to supervise the creation of a set of related clusters, though with some freedom in defining and creating the classes. We show that the advantage of using partially supervised clustering is that it is possible to have some control over the range of subjects that one would like the categorization system to address, but with a precise mathematical definition of how each category is defined. An extremely effective way then to categorize documents is to use this a priori knowledge of the definition of each category. We also discuss a new technique to help the classifier distinguish better among closely related clusters."
61,"A clear trend of the Web is that a variety of new consumer devices with diverse processing powers, display capabilities, and network connections is gaining access to the Internet. Tailoring Web content to match the device characteristics requires functionalities for content transformation, namely transcoding, that are typically carried out by the content provider or by some proxy server at the edge. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution consisting of an intermediate infrastructure of distributed servers which collaborate in discovering, transcoding, and delivering multiple versions of Web resources to the clients. We investigate different algorithms for cooperative discovery and transcoding in the context of this intermediate infrastructure where the servers are organized in hierarchical and flat peer-to-peer topologies. We compare the performance of the proposed schemes through a flexible prototype that implements all proposed mechanisms."
62,"It has become increasingly desirable for companies worldwide to outsource their complex e-business infrastructure under the utility computing paradigm by means of service level agreements (SLAs). A successful utility computing provider must be able not only to satisfy its customers' demand for high service-quality standards, but also to fulfill its service-quality commitments based upon business objectives (e.g., cost-effectively minimizing the exposed business impact of service level violations). This paper presents the design rationale of a business-objectives-based utility computing SLA management system, called SAM, along with implementation experiences."
63,"Pattern-based clustering is important in many applications,such as DNA micro-array data analysis, automaticrecommendation systems and target marketing systems.However, pattern-based clustering in large databasesis challenging. On the one hand, there can be a huge numberof clusters and many of them can be redundant and thusmake the pattern-based clustering ineffective. On the otherhand, the previous proposed methods may not be efficient orscalable in mining large databases.In this paper, we study the problem of maximal pattern-basedclustering. Redundant clusters are avoided completelyby mining only the maximal pattern-based clusters.MaPle, an efficient and scalable mining algorithm is developed.It conducts a depth-first, divide-and-conquer searchand prunes unnecessary branches smartly. Our extensiveperformance study on both synthetic data sets and real datasets shows that maximal pattern-based clustering is effective.It reduces the number of clusters substantially.

64,"Inductive learning searches an optimal hypothesis thatminimizes a given loss function. It is usually assumed thatthe simplest hypothesis that fits the data is the best approximateto an optimal hypothesis. Since finding the simplesthypothesis is NP-hard for most representations, we generallyemploy various heuristics to search its closest match.Computing these heuristics incurs significant cost, makinglearning inefficient and unscalable for large dataset. In thesame time, it is still questionable if the simplest hypothesisis indeed the closest approximate to the optimal model.Recent success of combining multiple models, such as bagging,boosting and meta-learning, has greatly improved theaccuracy of the simplest hypothesis, providing a strong argumentagainst the optimality of the simplest hypothesis.However, computing these combined hypotheses incurs significantlyhigher cost. In this paper, we first advert that aslong as the error of a hypothesis on each example is withina range dictated by a given loss function, it can still be optimal.Contrary to common beliefs, we propose a completelyrandom decision tree algorithm that achieves much higheraccuracy than the single best hypothesis and is comparableto boosted or bagged multiple best hypotheses. The advantageof multiple random tree is its training efficiency aswell as minimal memory requirement."
65,"This paper studies the problem of building text classifiersusing positive and unlabeled examples. The key feature ofthis problem is that there is no negative example forlearning. Recently, a few techniques for solving thisproblem were proposed in the literature. These techniquesare based on the same idea, which builds a classifier intwo steps. Each existing technique uses a different methodfor each step. In this paper, we first introduce some newmethods for the two steps, and perform a comprehensiveevaluation of all possible combinations of methods of thetwo steps. We then propose a more principled approachto solving the problem based on a biased formulation ofSVM, and show experimentally that it is more accuratethan the existing techniques."
66,"We devise in this paper a regression-based algorithm, called algorithm FTP-DS (Frequent Temporal Patterns of Data Streams), to mine frequent temporal patterns for data streams. While providing a general framework of pattern frequency counting, algorithm FTP-DS has two major features, namely one data scan for online statistics collection and regression-based compact pattern representation.To attain the feature of one data scan, the data segmentation and the pattern growth scenarios are explored for the frequency counting purpose. Algorithm FTP-DS scans online transaction flows and generates candidate frequent patterns in real time. The second important feature of algorithm FTP-DS is on the regression-based compact pattern representation. Specifically, to meet the space constraint, we devise for pattern representation a compact ATF (standing for Accumulated Time and Frequency) form to aggregately comprise all the information required for regression analysis. In addition, we develop the techniques of the segmentation tuning and segment relaxation to enhance the functions of FTP-DS. With these features, algorithm FTP-DS is able to not only conduct mining with variable time intervals but also perform trend detection effectively. Synthetic data and a real dataset which contains net-Permission work alarm logs from a major telecommunication company are utilized to verify the feasibility of algorithm FTP-DS."
67,"The clustering problem is a difficult problem for the data stream domain. This is because the large volumes of data arriving in a stream renders most traditional algorithms too inefficient. In recent years, a few one-pass clustering algorithms have been developed for the data stream problem. Although such methods address the scalability issues of the clustering problem, they are generally blind to the evolution of the data and do not address the following issues: (1) The quality of the clusters is poor when the data evolves considerably over time. (2) A data stream clustering algorithm requires much greater functionality in discovering and exploring clusters over different portions of the stream."
68,"In this paper, we study the problem of applying data mining to facilitate the investigation of money laundering crimes (MLCs). We have identified a new paradigm of problems --- that of automatic community generation based on uni-party data, the data in which there is no direct or explicit link information available. Consequently, we have proposed a new methodology for Link Discovery based on Correlation Analysis (LDCA). We have used MLC group model generation as an exemplary application of this problem paradigm, and have focused on this application to develop a specific method of automatic MLC group model generation based on timeline analysis using the LDCA methodology, called CORAL. A prototype of CORAL method has been implemented, and preliminary testing and evaluations based on a real MLC case data are reported. The contributions of this work are: (1) identification of the uni-party data community generation problem paradigm, (2) proposal of a new methodology LDCA to solve for problems in this paradigm, (3) formulation of the MLC group model generation problem as an example of this paradigm, (4) application of the LDCA methodology in developing a specific solution (CORAL) to the MLC group model generation problem, and (5) development, evaluation, and testing of the CORAL prototype in a real MLC case data."
69,"Recently, mining data streams with concept drifts for actionable insights has become an important and challenging task for a wide range of applications including credit card fraud protection, target marketing, network intrusion detection, etc. Conventional knowledge discovery tools are facing two challenges, the overwhelming volume of the streaming data, and the concept drifts. In this paper, we propose a general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams using weighted ensemble classifiers. We train an ensemble of classification models, such as C4.5, RIPPER, naive Beyesian, etc., from sequential chunks of the data stream. The classifiers in the ensemble are judiciously weighted based on their expected classification accuracy on the test data under the time-evolving environment. Thus, the ensemble approach improves both the efficiency in learning the model and the accuracy in performing classification. Our empirical study shows that the proposed methods have substantial advantage over single-classifier approaches in prediction accuracy, and the ensemble framework is effective for a variety of classification models."
70,"Most recent research of scalable inductive learning on very large dataset, decision tree construction in particular, focuses on eliminating memory constraints and reducing the number of sequential data scans. However, state-of-the-art decision tree construction algorithms still require multiple scans over the data set and use sophisticated control mechanisms and data structures. We first discuss a general inductive learning framework that scans the dataset exactly once. Then, we propose an extension based on Hoeffding's inequality that scans the dataset less than once. Our frameworks are applicable to a wide range of inductive learners."

72,"With the growing importance of XML in data exchange, much research has been done in providing flexible query facilities to extract data from structured XML documents. In this paper, we propose ViST, a novel index structure for searching XML documents. By representing both XML documents and XML queries in structure-encoded sequences, we show that querying XML data is equivalent to finding subsequence matches. Unlike index methods that disassemble a query into multiple sub-queries, and then join the results of these sub-queries to provide the final answers, ViST uses tree structures as the basic unit of query to avoid expensive join operations. Furthermore, ViST provides a unified index on both content and structure of the XML documents, hence it has a performance advantage over methods indexing either just content or structure. ViST supports dynamic index update, and it relies solely on B+ Trees without using any specialized data structures that are not well supported by DBMSs. Our experiments show that ViST is effective, scalable, and efficient in supporting structural queries."

The focus of our research is ontechniques for automatically constructing anomaly detectionmodels that are capable of detecting new (or unseen)attacks. We introduce a new data mining method that performs"cross-feature analysis" to capture the inter-featurecorrelation patterns in normal traffic. These patterns can beused as normal profiles to detect deviation (or anomalies)caused by attacks. We have implemented our method on afew well known ad-hoc routing protocols, namely, DynamicSource Routing (DSR) and Ad-hoc On-Demand DistanceVector (AODV), and have conducted extensive experimentson the ns-2 simulator. The results show that the anomalydetection models automatically computed using our datamining method can effectively detect anomalies caused bytypical routing intrusions."

In these systems, the first-level dispatching is achieved through the Domain Name System (DNS) during the address lookup phase. Distributed Web systems can use some request redirection mechanism as a second-level dispatching because the DNS routing scheme has limited control on offered load. Redirection is always executed by the servers, but there are many alternatives that are worth of investigation. In this paper, we explore the combination of DNS dispatching with redirection schemes that use centralized or distributed control on the basis of global or local state information. In the fully distributed schemes, DNS dispatching is carried out by simple algorithms because load sharing are taken by some redirection mechanisms that each server activates autonomously. On the other hand, in fully centralized schemes, redirection is used as a tool to enforce the decisions taken by the same centralized entity that provides the first-level dispatching. We also investigate some hybrid strategies. We conclude that the distributed algorithms are preferable over the centralized counterpart because they provide stable performance, can take content-aware dispatching decisions, can limit the percentage of redirected requests and, last, but not least, their implementation is much simpler than that required by the centralized schemes."
77,"Microarrays are one of the latest breakthroughs in experimental molecular biology, which provide a powerful tool by which the expression patterns of thousands of genes can be monitored simultaneously and are already producing huge amount of valuable data. The concept of bicluster was introduced by Cheng and Church (2000) to capture the coherence of a subset of genes and a subset of conditions. A set of heuristic algorithms were also designed to either find one bicluster or a set of biclusters, which consist of iterations of masking null values and discovered biclusters, coarse and fine node deletion, node addition, and the inclusion of inverted data. These heuristics inevitably suffer from some serious drawback. The masking of null values and discovered biclusters with random numbers may result in the phenomenon of random interference which in turn impacts the discovery of high qualitybiclusters.To address this issue and to further accelerate the biclustering process, we generalize the model of bicluster to incorporate null values and propose a probabilistic algorithm (FLOC) that can discover a set of k possibly overlapping biclusters simultaneously. Furthermore, this algorithm can easily be extended to support additional features that suit different requirements at virtually little cost. Experimental study on the yeast gene expressiondata shows that the FLOC algorithm can offer substantial improvements over the previously proposed algorithm."
78,"Periodicy detection in time series data is a challenging problem of great importance in many applications. Most previous work focused on mining synchronous periodic patterns and did not recognize the misaligned presence of a pattern due to the intervention of random noise. In this paper, we propose a more flexible model of asynchronous periodic pattern that may be present only within a subsequence and whose occurrences may be shifted due to disturbance. Two parameters min_rep and max_dis are employed to specify the minimum number of repetitions that is required within each segment of nondisrupted pattern occurrences and the maximum allowed disturbance between any two successive valid segments. Upon satisfying these two requirements, the longest valid subsequence of a pattern is returned. A two-phase algorithm is devised to first generate potential periods by distance-based pruning followed by an iterative procedure to derive and validate candidate patterns and locate the longest valid subsequence. We also show that this algorithm cannot only provide linear time complexity with respect to the length of the sequence but also achieve space efficiency."
79,"In many data mining applications, the objective is to select data cases of a target class. For example, in direct marketing, marketers want to select likely buyers of a particular product for promotion. In such applications, it is often too difficult to predict who will definitely be in the target class (e.g., the buyer class) because the data used for modeling is often very noisy and has a highly imbalanced class distribution. Traditionally, classification systems are used to solve this problem. Instead of classifying each data case to a definite class (e.g., buyer or non-buyer), a classification system is modified to produce a class probability estimate (or a score) for the data case to indicate the likelihood that the data case belongs to the target class (e.g., the buyer class). However, existing classification systems only aim to find a subset of the regularities or rules that exist in data. This subset of rules only gives a partial picture of the domain. In this paper, we show that the target selection problem can be mapped to association rule mining to provide a more powerful solution to the problem. Since association rule mining aims to find all rules in data, it is thus able to give a complete picture of the underlying relationships in the domain. The complete set of rules enables us to assign a more accurate class probability estimate to each data case. This paper proposes an effective and efficient technique to compute class probability estimates using association rules. Experiment results using public domain data and real-life application data show that in general the new technique performs markedly better than the state-of-the-art classification system C4.5, boosted C4.5, and the Naïve Bayesian system."
80,"Hash routing is an emerging approach to coordinating a collection of collaborative proxy caches. Hash routing partitions the entire URL space among the proxy caches. Each partition is assigned to a cache server. Duplication of cache contents is eliminated. Client requests to a cache server for non-assigned-partition objects are forwarded to proper sibling caches. In the presence of access skew, the load level of the cache servers can be quite unbalanced, limiting the benefits of hash routing."
81,"Energy saving is one of the most important issues in wireless mobile computing. Among others, one viable approach to achieving energy saving is to use an indexed data organization to broadcast data over wireless channels to mobile units. Using indexed broadcasting, mobile units can be guided to the data of interest efficiently and only need to be actively listening to the broadcasting channel when the relevant information is present. In this paper, we explore the issue of indexing data with skewed access for sequential broadcasting in wireless mobile computing. We first propose methods to build index trees based on access frequencies of data records. To minimize the average cost of index probes, we consider two cases: one for fixed index fanouts and the other for variant index fanouts, and devise algorithms to construct index trees for both cases. We show that the cost of index probes can be minimized not only by employing an imbalanced index tree that is designed in accordance with data access skew, but also by exploiting variant fanouts for index nodes. Note that, even for the same index tree, different broadcasting orders of data records will lead to different average data access times. To address this issue, we develop an algorithm to determine the optimal order for sequential data broadcasting to minimize the average data access time. Performance evaluation on the algorithms proposed is conducted. Examples and remarks are given to illustrate our results."
82,"In this paper, we focus on mining periodic patterns allowing some degreeof imperfection in the form of random replacement from a perfectperiodic pattern. Information gain was proposed to identify patternswith events of vastly different occurrence frequencies and adjust forthe deviation from a pattern. However, it does not take any penaltyif there exists some gap between the pattern occurrences. In manyapplications, e.g., bio-informatics, it is important to identify subsequencesthat a pattern repeats perfectly (or near perfectly). As a solution,we extend the information gain measure to include a penaltyfor gaps between pattern occurrences. We call this measure as generalizedinformation gain. Furthermore, we want to find subsequenceS' such that for a pattern P , the generalized information gain of Pin S' is high. This is particularly useful in locating repeats in DNAsequences. In this paper, we developed an effective mining algorithm,InfoMiner+, to simultaneously mine significant patterns and the as-sociatedsubsequences."
83,"Presently, inductive learning is still performed in a frustratingbatch process. The user has little interaction withthe system and no control over the final accuracy and trainingtime. If the accuracy of the produced model is too low,all the computing resources are misspent. In this paper, wepropose a progressive modeling framework. In progressivemodeling, the learning algorithm estimates online both theaccuracy of the final model and remaining training time. Ifthe estimated accuracy is far below expectation, the usercan terminate training prior to completion without wastingfurther resources. If the user chooses to complete the learningprocess, progressive modeling will compute a modelwith expected accuracy in expected time. We describe oneimplementation of progressive modeling using ensemble ofclassifiers."
84,"Association rule mining aims at discovering patternswhose support is beyond a given threshold. Mining patternscomposed of items described by an arbitrary subset ofattributes in a large relational table represents a new challengeand has various practical applications, including theevent management systems that motivated this work. Theattribute combinations that define the items in a pattern providethe structural information of the pattern. Current associationalgorithms do not make full use of the structuralinformation of the patterns: the information is either lostafter it is encoded with attribute values, or is constrainedby a given hierarchy or taxonomy. Pattern structures conveyimportant knowledge about the patterns. In this paper,we present a novel architecture that organizes the miningspace based on pattern structures. By exploiting the inter-relationshipsamong pattern structures, execution times formining can be reduced significantly. This advantage isdemonstrated by our experiments using both synthetic andreal-life datasets."
85,"Monitoring continual queries or subscriptions is to determine the subset of all queries or subscriptions whose predicates match a given event. Predicates contain not only equality but also non-equality clauses. Event matching is usually accomplished by first identifying a "small" candidate set of subscriptions for an event and then determining the matched subscriptions from the candidate set. Prior work has focused on using equality clauses to identify the candidate set. However, we found that completely ignoring non-equality clauses can result in a much larger candidate set. In this paper, we present and evaluate an adaptive multiple key hashing (AMKH) method to judiciously include an effective subset of non-equality clauses in candidate set identification. Each subscription is mapped to a data point in a multidimensional space based on its predicate clauses. AMKH is then used to maintain subscriptions and perform event matching. AMKH further provides a controlling mechanism to limit the hash range of a non-equality clause, hence reducing the size of the candidate set. Simulations are conducted to study the performance of AMKH. The results show that (1) a small number of non-equality clauses can be effectively included by AMKH and (2) the attributes whose overall non-equality predicate clauses are most selective should be chosen for inclusion by AMKH."
86,"The results discussed in this paper are relevant to a large database consisting of consumer profile information together with behavioral (transaction) patterns. We introduce the concept of profile association rules, which discusses the problem of relating consumer buying behavior to profile information. The problem of online mining of profile association rules in this large database is discussed. We show how to use multidimensional indexing structures in order to actually perform the mining. The use of multidimensional indexing structures to perform profile mining provides considerable advantages in terms of the ability to perform very generic range-based online queries."

Techniques are proposed for effective categorization, management, and personalization of news feeds obtained from a live news wire service. The process consists of two steps: first manual input is required to build the domain knowledge which could be site-specific; then the automated component uses this domain knowledge in order to perform the personalization, categorization and presentation. Effective schemes for advertising are proposed, where the targeting is done using both the information about the user and the content of the web page on which the advertising icon appears. Automated techniques for identifying sudden variations in news patterns are described; these may be used for supporting news-alerts.

89,"Bioinformatics has become an active research area in recent years. The amount of mapped sequences doubles every fourteen months. BLAST has been widely employed for retrievingsequences which has similar portion(s) to a given sequence. However, BLAST has to scan the entire database every time when a query is issued. This can be very time consuming especially when the database is large. In this paper, we study the problem on how to build a persistent index structure for protein sequences to support approximate match. The suffix tree has been proposed as a solution to index sequence database and has been deployed on organizing DNA sequences (Hunt et al. 2001). Unfortunately, it suffers from the problem of "memory bottleneck" that prevents it from being applied efficiently to a large database. The performance even degrades further for protein database due to a larger fanout at each node. Here, we employ an indexing structure, called BASS-tree, to support approximate match in sublinear time on a large protein database. We call this indexing method as sequence approximate match (SAM) index method. The search of approximate matches can be properly directed to the portion in the database with a high potential of matching quickly. It has been demonstrated in our experiments that the potential performance improvement is in an order of magnitude over alternative methods such as the BLAST algorithm and the suffix tree."
90,"The DNA microarray technology is about to bring an explosion of gene expression data that may dwarf even the human sequencing projects. Researchers are motivated to identify genes whose expression levels rise and fall coherently under a set of experimental perturbances, that is, they exhibit fluctuation of a similar shape when conditions change. In this paper, we show that queries based on pattern correlations against large-scale microarray databases can be supported by the weighted-sequence model, an index structure designed for sequence matching. A weighted-sequence is a two-dimensional structure where each element in thesequence is associated with a weight. We transform the DNA microarray data, as well as pattern-based queries, into weighted-sequences, and use subsequence matching algorithms to retrieve from the database all genes that match the query pattern. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and real-world data sets, that our method is effective and efficient."
91,"Previous research has shown that averaging ensemble can scale up learning over very large cost-sensitive datasets with linear speedup independent of the learning algorithms. At the same time, it achieves the same or even better accuracy than a single model computed from the entire dataset. However, one major drawback is its inefficiency in prediction since every base model in the ensemble has to be consulted in order to produce a final prediction. In this paper, we propose several approaches to reduce the number of base classifiers. Among various methods explored, our empirical studies have shown that the benefit-based greedy approach can safely remove more than 90% of the base models while maintaining or even exceeding the prediction accuracy of the original ensemble. Assuming that each base classifier consumes one unit of prediction time, the removal of 90% of base classifiers translates to a prediction speedup of 10 times. On top of pruning, we propose a novel dynamic scheduling approach to further reduce the "expected" number of classifiers employed in prediction. It measures the confidence of a prediction by a subset of classifiers in the pruned ensemble. This confidence is used to decide if more classifiers are needed in order to produce a prediction that is the same as the original unpruned ensemble. This approach reduces the "expected" number of classifiers by another 25% to 75% without loss of accuracy."
92,"In this paper, we broaden the horizon of traditional rule mining by introducing a new framework of causality rule mining in a distributed chain store database. Specifically, the causality rule explored in this paper consists of a sequence of triggering events and a set of consequential events, and is designed with the capability of mining non-sequential, inter-transaction information. Hence, the causality rule mining provides a very general framework for rule derivation. Note, however, that the procedure of causality rule mining is very costly particularly in the presence of a huge number of candidate sets and a distributed database, and in our opinion, cannot be dealt with by direct extensions from existing rule mining methods. Consequently, we devise in this paper a series of level matching algorithms, including Level Matching (abbreviatedly as LM), Level Matching with Selective Scan (abbreviatedly as LMS), and Distributed Level Matching (abbreviatedly as Distibuted LM), to minimize the computing cost needed for the distributed data mining of causality rules. In addition, the phenomena of time window constraints are also taken into consideration for the development of our algorithms. As a result of properly employing the technologies of level matching and selective scan, the proposed algorithms present good efficiency and scalability in the mining of local and global causality rules. Scale-up experiments show that the proposed algorithms scale well with the number of sites and the number of customer transactions.Index Terms: knowledge discovery, distributed data mining causality rules, triggering events, consequential events"
93,"We consider efficient communication schemes based on both network-supported and application-level multicast techniques for content-based publication-subscription systems. We show that the communication costs depend heavily on the network configurations, distribution of publications and subscriptions. We devise new algorithms and adapt existing partitional data clustering algorithms. These algorithms can be used to determine multicast groups with as much commonality as possible, based on the totality of subscribers' interests. They perform well in the context of highly heterogeneous subscriptions, and they also scale well. An efficiency of 60% to 80% with respect to the ideal solution can be achieved with a small number of multicast groups (less than 100 in our experiments). Some of these same concepts can be applied to match publications to subscribers in real-time, and also to determine dynamically whether unicast, multicast or broadcast information about the events over the network to the matched subscribers. We demonstrate the quality of our algorithms via simulation experiments."
94,"Table summarization is important in mobile commerce as many diverse small devices, such as smart phones and personal digital assistants,are being equipped with applications that can access corporate databases. It is difficult to effectively present a large table of information on small devices as they tend to have limited display and processing capabilities. Hence, large tables need to be reduced and summarized in order to be properly displayed on small devices. Due to updates in the databases, device capabilities and personal preferences, a summarized table based on a previously defined specification may not be satisfactory anymore and requires further refinements. In this paper, we present a flexible and lightweight implementationof dynamic refinement of table summarization. With a GUI tool or a browser, the user of a small device in M-commerce can dynamically and interactively refine a summarized table until he/she is satisfied. Not only the summarized table output but also the corresponding specification are refined. Individual refined specifications are flexibly and efficiently maintained for subsequent table summarization."
95,"Pattern discovery in long sequences is of great importance in many applications including computational biology study, consumer behavior analysis, system performance analysis, etc. In a noisy environment, an observed sequence may not accurately reflect the underlying behavior. For example, in a protein sequence, the amino acid N is likely to mutate to D with little impact to the biological function of the protein. It would be desirable if the occurrence of D in the observation can be related to a possible mutation from N in an appropriate manner. Unfortunately, the support measure (i.e., the number of occurrences) of a pattern does not serve this purpose. In this paper, we introduce the concept of compatibility matrix as the means to provide a probabilistic connection from the observation to the underlying true value. A new metric match is also proposed to capture the "real support" of a pattern which would be expected if a noise-free environment is assumed. In addition, in the context we address, a pattern could be very long. The standard pruning technique developed for the market basket problem may not work efficiently. As a result, a novel algorithm that combines statistical sampling and a new technique (namely border collapsing) is devised to discover long patterns in a minimal number of scans of the sequence database with sufficiently high confidence. Empirical results demonstrate the robustness of the match model (with respect to the noise) and the efficiency of the probabilistic algorithm."
96,"Clustering is the process of grouping a set of objects into classes of similar objects. Although definitions of similarity vary from one clustering model to another, in most of these models the concept of similarity is based on distances, e.g., Euclidean distance or cosine distance. In other words, similar objects are required to have close values on at least a set of dimensions. In this paper, we explore a more general type of similarity. Under the pCluster model we proposed, two objects are similar if they exhibit a coherent pattern on a subset of dimensions. For instance, in DNA microarray analysis, the expression levels of two genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of environmental stimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close, the patterns they exhibit can be very much alike. Discovery of such clusters of genes is essential in revealing significant connections in gene regulatory networks. E-commerce applications, such as collaborative filtering, can also benefit from the new model, which captures not only the closeness of values of certain leading indicators but also the closeness of (purchasing, browsing, etc.) patterns exhibited by the customers. Our paper introduces an effective algorithm to detect such clusters, and we perform tests on several real and synthetic data sets to show its effectiveness."
97,"The overall increase in traffic on the World Wide Web is augmenting user-perceived response times from popular Web sites, especially in conjunction with special events. System platforms that do not replicate information content cannot provide the needed scalability to handle large traffic volumes and to match rapid and dramatic changes in the number of clients. The need to improve the performance of Web-based services has produced a variety of novel content delivery architectures. This article will focus on Web system architectures that consist of multiple server nodes distributed on a local area, with one or more mechanisms to spread client requests among the nodes. After years of continual proposals of new system solutions, routing mechanisms, and policies (the first dated back to 1994 when the NCSA Web site had to face the first million of requests per day), many problems concerning multiple server architectures for Web sites have been solved. Other issues remain to be addressed, especially at the network application layer, but the main techniques and methodologies for building scalable Web content delivery architectures placed in a single location are settled now. This article classifies and describes main mechanisms to split the traffic load among the server nodes, discussing both the alternative architectures and the load sharing policies. To this purpose, it focuses on architectures, internal routing mechanisms, and dispatching request algorithms for designing and implementing scalable Web-server systems under the control of one content provider. It identifies also some of the open research issues associated with the use of distributed systems for highly accessed Web sites."
98,"Web Search Engines employ multiple so-called crawlers to maintain local copies of web pages. But these web pages are frequently updated by their owners, and therefore the crawlers must regularly revisit the web pages to maintain the freshness of their local copies. In this paper, we propose a two-part scheme to optimize this crawling process. One goal might be the minimization of the average level of staleness over all web pages, and the scheme we propose can solve this problem. Alternatively, the same basic scheme could be used to minimize a possibly more important search engine embarrassment level metric: The frequency with which a client makes a search engine query and then clicks on a returned url only to find that the result is incorrect. The first part our scheme determines the (nearly) optimal crawling frequencies, as well as the theoretically optimal times to crawl each web page. It does so within an extremely general stochastic framework, one which supports a wide range of complex update patterns found in practice. It uses techniques from probability theory and the theory of resource allocation problems which are highly computationally efficient -- crucial for practicality because the size of the problem in the web environment is immense. The second part employs these crawling frequencies and ideal crawl times as input, and creates an optimal achievable schedule for the crawlers. Our solution, based on network flow theory, is exact as well as highly efficient. An analysis of the update patterns from a highly accessed and highly dynamic web site is used to gain some insights into the properties of page updates in practice. Then, based on this analysis, we perform a set of detailed simulation experiments to demonstrate the quality and speed of our approach."
99,"Replication of information across multiple servers is becoming a common approach to support popular Web sites. A distributed architecture with some mechanisms to assign client requests to Web servers is more scalable than any centralized or mirrored architecture. In this paper, we consider distributed systems in which the Authoritative Domain Name Server (ADNS) of the Web site takes the request dispatcher role by mapping the URL hostname into the IP address of a visible node, that is, a Web server or a Web cluster interface. This architecture can support local and geographical distribution of the Web servers. However, the ADNS controls only a very small fraction of the requests reaching the Web site because the address mapping is not requested for each client access. Indeed, to reduce Internet traffic, address resolution is cached at various name servers for a time-to-live (TTL) period. This opens an entirely new set of problems that traditional centralized schedulers of parallel/distributed systems do not have to face. The heterogeneity assumption on Web node capacity, which is much more likely in practice, increases the order of complexity of the request assignment problem and severely affects the applicability and performance of the existing load sharing algorithms. We propose new assignment strategies, namely adaptive TTL schemes, which tailor the TTL value for each address mapping instead of using a fixed value for all mapping requests. The adaptive TTL schemes are able to address both the nonuniformity of client requests and the heterogeneous capacity of Web server nodes. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms are very effective in avoiding node overload, even for high levels of heterogeneity and limited ADNS control."
100,"Clustering problems are well-known in the database literature for their use in numerous applications, such as customer segmentation, classification, and trend analysis. High-dimensional data has always been a challenge for clustering algorithms because of the inherent sparsity of the points. Recent research results indicate that, in high-dimensional data, even the concept of proximity or clustering may not be meaningful. We introduce a very general concept of projected clustering which is able to construct clusters in arbitrarily aligned subspaces of lower dimensionality. The subspaces are specific to the clusters themselves. This definition is substantially more general and realistic than the currently available techniques which limit the method to only projections from the original set of attributes. The generalized projected clustering technique may also be viewed as a way of trying to redefine clustering for high-dimensional applications by searching for hidden subspaces with clusters which are created by interattribute correlations. We provide a new concept of using extended cluster feature vectors in order to make the algorithm scalable for very large databases. The running time and space requirements of the algorithm are adjustable and are likely to trade-off with better accuracy."
101,"A critical issue in the performance of a video-on-demand system is the I/O bandwidth required in order to satisfy client requests. A number of techniques have been proposed in order to reduce these bandwidth requirements. In this paper we concentrate on one such technique, known as adaptive piggybacking. We develop and analyze piggyback merging policies which are optimal over large classes of reasonable methods."
102,"In this paper, we discuss a technique for discovering localized associations in segments of the data using clustering. Often, the aggregate behavior of a data set may be very different from localized segments. In such cases, it is desirable to design algorithms which are effective in discovering localized associations because they expose a customer pattern which is more specific than the aggregate behavior. This information may be very useful for target marketing. We present empirical results which show that the method is indeed able to find a significantly larger number of associations than what can be discovered by analysis of the aggregate data."
103,"Discovery of periodic patterns in time series data has become an active research area with many applications. These patterns can be hierarchical in nature, where higher level pattern may consist of repetitions of lower level patterns.Unfortunately, the presence of noise m y prevent these higher level patterns from being recognized in the sense that two portions (of data sequence) that support the same (high level) pattern may have different layouts of occurrences of basic symbols. There may not exist any common representation in terms of raw symbol combinations; and hence such (high level) pattern may not be expressed by any previous model (defined on raw symbols or symbol combinations) and would not be properly recognized by any existing method. In this paper, we propose novel model, namely meta-pattern, to capture these high level patterns. As more flexible model, the number of potential meta-patterns could be very large. A substantial difficulty lies on how to identify the proper pattern candidates. However, the well-known Apriori property is not able to provide sufficient pruning power. A new property, namely component location property, is identified and used to conduct the candidate generation so that an efficient computation-based mining algorithm can be developed. Last but not least, we apply our algorithm to some real and synthetic sequences and some interesting patterns are discovered."
104,"Similarity search in text has proven to be an interesting problem from the qualitative perspective because of inherent redundancies and ambiguities in textual descriptions. The methods used in search engines in order to retrieve documents most similar to user-defined sets of keywords are not applicable to targets which are medium to large size documents, because of even greater noise effects stemming from the presence of a large number of words unrelated to the overall topic in the document. The inverted representation is the dominant method for indexing text, but it is not as suitable for document-to-document similarity search, as for short user-queries. One way of improving the quality of similarity search is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which maps the documents from the original set of words to a concept space. U fortunately, LSI maps the data into a domain in which it is not possible to provide effectiveindexing techniques. In this paper, we investigate new ways of providing conceptual search among documents bycreating a representation in terms of conceptual word-chains. This technique also allows effective indexing techniques so that similarity queries ca be performed on large collectionsof documents by accessing a small amount of data. We demonstrate that our scheme outperforms standard textual similarity search o the inverted representation both in terms of quality a d search efficiency."
105,"Decision trees are one of the most extensively used data mining models. Recently, a number of efficient, scalable algorithms for constructing decision trees on large disk-resident dataset have been introduced. In this paper, we study the problem of learning scalable decision trees from datasets with biased class distribution. Our objective is to build decision trees that are ore concise and oreinterpretable while maintaining the scalability of the model.To achieve this, our approach searches for subspace clusters of data cases of the biased class to enable multivariate splittings based on weighted distances to such clusters. In orderto build concise and interpretable models, other approaches including multivariate decision trees and association rules, often introduce scalability and performance issues. The SSDT algorithm we present achieves the objective without loss in efficiency, scalability, and accuracy."
106,"In this article we propose a novel, yet practical, scheme which attempts to optimally balance the load on the servers of a clustered Web farm. The goal in solving this performance problem is to achieve minimal average response time for customer requests, and thus ultimately achieve maximal customer throughput. The article decouples the overall problem into two related but distinct mathematical subproblems, one static and one dynamic. We believe this natural decoupling is one of the major contributions of our article. The static component algorithm determines good assignments of sites to potentially overlapping servers. These cluster assignments, which, due to overhead, cannot be changed too frequently, have a major effect on achievable response time. Additionally, these assignments must be palatable to the sites themselves. The dynamic component algorithm is designed to handle real-time load balancing by routing customer requests from the network dispatcher to the servers. This algorithm must react to fluctuating customer request load while respecting the assignments of sites to servers determined by the static component. The static and dynamic components both employ in various contexts the same so-called goal setting algorithm. This algorithm determines the theoretically optimal load on each server, given hypothetical cluster assignments and site activity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall load-balancing scheme via a number of simulation experiments."
107,"The large itemset model has been proposed in the literature for finding associations in a large database of sales transactions. A different method for evaluating and finding itemsets referred to as strongly collective itemsets is proposed. We propose a criterion stressing the importance of the actual correlation of the items with one another rather than their absolute level of presence. Previous techniques for finding correlated itemsets are not necessarily applicable to very large databases. We provide an algorithm which provides very good computational efficiency, while maintaining statistical robustness. The fact that this algorithm relies on relative measures rather than absolute measures such as support also implies that the method can be applied to find association rules in data sets in which items may appear in a sizeable percentage of the transactions (dense data sets), data sets in which the items have varying density, or even negative association rules."
108,"The nearest neighbor search is an important operation widely-used in multimedia databases. In higher dimensions, most of previous methods for nearest neighbor search become inefficient and require to compute nearest neighbor distances to a large fraction of points in the space. In this paper, we present a new approach for processing nearest neighbor search with the Euclidean metric, which searches over only a small subset of the original space. This approach effectively approximates clusters by encapsulating them into geometrically regular shapes and also computes better upper and lower bounds of the distances from the query point to the clusters. For showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we perform extensive experiments. The results reveal that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the X-tree as well as the sequential scan."
109,"We provide scheduling algorithms that attempt to maximize the profits of a broadcast-based electronic delivery service for digital products purchased, for example, at e-commerce sites on the World Wide Web. Examples of such products include multimedia objects such as CDs and DVDs. Other examples include software and, with increasing popularity, electronic books as well. We consider two separate alternatives, depending in part on the sophistication of the set-top box receiving the product at the customer end. The first, more restrictive option, assumes that the atomic unit of transmission of the product is the entire object, which must be transmitted in order from start to finish. We provide a solution based in part on a transportation problem formulation for this so-called noncyclic scheduling problem. The second alternative, which is less restrictive, assumes that the product may be transmitted cyclically in smaller segments, starting from an arbitrary point in the object. Three heuristics are provided for this difficult cyclic scheduling problem. Both scenarios assume that the broadcasts of the same digital product to multiple customers can be batched. We examine the effectiveness of these algorithms via simulation experiments under varying parametric assumptions. Each of the three cyclic scheduling algorithms perform better than the noncyclic algorithm. Moreover, one of the cyclic scheduling algorithms emerges as the clear winner."
110,"In this paper, we focus on mining surprising periodic patterns in a sequence of events. In many applications, e.g., computational biology, an infrequent pattern is still considered very significant if its actual occurrence frequency exceeds the prior expectation by a large margin. The traditional metric, such as support, is not necessarily the ideal model to measure this kind of surprising patterns because it treats all patterns equally in the sense that every occurrence carries the same weight towards the assessment of the significance of a pattern regardless of the probability of occurrence. A more suitable measurement, information, is introduced to naturally value the degree of surprise of each occurrence of a pattern as a continuous and monotonically decreasing function of its probability of occurrence. This would allow patterns with vastly different occurrence probabilities to be handled seamlessly. As the accumulated degree of surprise of all repetitions of a pattern, the concept of information gain is proposed to measure the overall degree of surprise of the pattern within a data sequence. The bounded information gain property is identified to tackle the predicament caused by the violation of the downward closure property by the information gain measure and in turn provides an efficient solution to this problem. Empirical tests demonstrate the efficiency and the usefulness of the proposed model."
111,"Ever since the beginning of the Web, finding useful information from the Web has been an important problem. Existing approaches include keyword-based search, wrapper-based information extraction, Web query and user preferences. These approaches essentially find information that matches the user's explicit specifications. This paper argues that this is insufficient. There is another type of information that is also of great interest, i.e., unexpected information, which is unanticipated by the user. Finding unexpected information is useful in many applications. For example, it is useful for a company to find unexpected information bout its competitors, e.g., unexpected services and products that its competitors offer. With this information, the company can learn from its competitors and/or design counter measures to improve its competitiveness. Since the number of pages of a typical commercial site is very large and there are also many relevant sites (competitors), it is very difficult for a human user to view each page to discover the unexpected information. Automated assistance is needed. In this paper, we propose a number of methods to help the user find various types of unexpected information from his/her competitors' Web sites. Experiment results show that these techniques are very useful in practice and also efficient."
112,"In recent years, the World Wide Web has shown enormous growth in size. Vast repositories of information are available on practically every possible topic. In such cases, it is valuable to perform topical resource discovery effectively. Consequently, several new ideas have been proposed in recent years; among them a key technique is focused crawling which is able to crawl particular topical portions of the World Wide Web quickly, without having to explore all web pages. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of intelligent crawling which actually learns characteristics of the linkage structure of the World Wide Web while performing the crawling. Specifically, the intelligent crawler uses the inlinking web page content, candidate URL structure, or other behaviors of the inlinking web pages or siblings in order to estimate the probability that a candidate is useful for a given crawl. This is a much more general framework than the focused crawling technique which is based on a pre-defined understanding of the topical structure of the web. The techniques discussed in this paper are applicable for crawling web pages which satisfy arbitrary user-defined predicates such as topical queries, keyword queries, or any combinations of the above. Unlike focused crawling, it is not necessary to provide representative topical examples, since the crawler can learn its way into the appropriate topic. We refer to this technique as intelligent crawling because of its adaptive nature in adjusting to the web page linkage structure. We discuss how to intelligently select features which are most useful for a given crawl. The learning crawler is capable of reusing the knowledge gained in a given crawl in order to provide more efficient crawling for closely related predicates."
113,"We discuss the problem of online mining of association rules in a large database of sales transactions. The online mining is performed by preprocessing the data effectively in order to make it suitable for repeated online queries. We store the preprocessed data in such a way that online processing may be done by applying a graph theoretic search algorithm whose complexity is proportional to the size of the output. The result is an online algorithm which is independent of the size of the transactional data and the size of the preprocessed data. The algorithm is almost instantaneous in the size of the output. The algorithm also supports techniques for quickly discovering association rules from large itemsets. The algorithm is capable of finding rules with specific items in the antecedent or consequent. These association rules are presented in a compact form, eliminating redundancy. The use of nonredundant association rules helps significantly in the reduction of irrelevant noise in the data mining process."
114,"Abstract: Personalization of Web contents has been widely adopted. It provides users with a more customized experience of a Web site. In this paper, we describe a prototype system, called Dynamic Profiler, that generates dynamic user profiles for personalization. The system can be used in many personalized applications, including targeted advertising, product or content recommendations, and user community services. It uses content-based collaborative filtering techniques to create dynamic user profiles, form user communities and make recommendations. The system analyzes user logs, fetches the documents accessed and categorizes them. Each user is then described by a vector of document categories. Such user characterizations are then used to find user communities based on a projected clustering scheme. The log processing and content categorization are run periodically off-line to capture dynamic user profiles, which are then used online for personalized applications."
115,"The outlier detection problem has important applications in the field of fraud detection, network robustness analysis, and intrusion detection. Most such applications are high dimensional domains in which the data can contain hundreds of dimensions. Many recent algorithms use concepts of proximity in order to find outliers based on their relationship to the rest of the data. However, in high dimensional space, the data is sparse and the notion of proximity fails to retain its meaningfulness. In fact, the sparsity of high dimensional data implies that every point is an almost equally good outlier from the perspective of proximity-based definitions. Consequently, for high dimensional data, the notion of finding meaningful outliers becomes substantially more complex and non-obvious. In this paper, we discuss new techniques for outlier detection which find the outliers by studying the behavior of projections from the data set."

117,"We propose a scheme which attempts to optimally balance the load on the servers of a clustered web farm. Solving this performance problem is crucial to achieving minimal average response time for customer requests, and thus ultimately to achieving maximal customer throughput. This short paper gives an overview of three new mathematical contributions. First, we describe a goal setting algorithm to determine the load on each server which minimizes the average customer request response time given the possibly overlapping cluster assignments of sites to servers and the current customer request load for each site. The cluster assignments, which of necessity can only be changed relatively infrequently, have a major effect on the optimal response time in the goal setting component. So, second, we describe a static algorithm which determines good assignments of sites to servers. Third, and finally, we describe a dynamic algorithm which handles the real-time server load balancing, reacting to the fluctuating customer request load in order to come as close as possible to achieving the idealized optimal average response time. We examine the performance of the overall load balancing scheme via simulation experiments."
118,"In a video-on-demand environment, batching of video requests is often used to reduce I/O demand and improve throughput. Since viewers may defect if they experience long waits, a good video scheduling policy needs to consider not only the batch size but also the viewer defection probabilities and wait times. Two conventional scheduling policies for batching are the first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy, which schedules the video with the longest waiting request, and the maximum queue length (MQL) policy, which selects the video with the maximum number of waiting requests. Neither of these policies leads to entirely satisfactory results. MQL tends to be too aggressive in scheduling popular videos by considering only the queue length to maximize batch size, while FCFS has the opposite effect by completely ignoring the queue length and focusing on arrival time to reduce defections. In this paper, we introduce the notion of factored queue length and propose a batching policy that schedules the video with the maximum factored queue length. We refer to this as the MFQL policy. The factored queue length is obtained by weighting each video queue length with a factor which is biased against the more popular videos. An optimization problem is formulated to solve for the best weighting factors for the various videos. We also consider MFQL implementation issues. A simulation is developed to compare the proposed MFQL variants with FCFS and MQL. Our study shows that MFQL yields excellent empirical results in terms of standard performance measures such as average latency time, defection rates, and fairness."
119,"The Second International Workshop on Advanced Issues of E-Commerce and Web-Based Information Systems (WECWIS 2000) was held at the Crowne Plaza San Jose/Silicon Valley in Milpitas, California on June 8-9, 2000. The purpose of this workshop was to bring together leading practitioners, developers and researchers to explore the challenging technical issues and find feasible solutions for advancing the current state of the art in e-commerce and web-based information systems. In particular, the workshop was interested in the infrastructure issues to facilitate e-commerce and Web-based information systems.WECWIS 2000 was successful. There were three invited talks, one industrial panel discussion and six technical sessions.

120,"Users of highly popular Web sites may experience long delays when accessing information. Upgrading content site infrastructure from a single node to a locally distributed Web cluster composed by multiple server nodes provides a limited relief, because the cluster wide-area connectivity may become the bottleneck. A better solution is to distribute Web clusters over the Internet by placing content nodes in strategic locations. A geographically distributed architecture where the Domain Name System (DNS) servers evaluate network proximity and users are served from the closest cluster reduces network impact on response time. On the other hand, serving closest requests only may cause un-balanced servers and may increase system impact on response time. To achieve a scalable Web system, we propose to integrate DNS proximity scheduling with an HTTP request redirection mechanism that any Web server can activate. We demonstrate through simulation experiments that this further dispatching mechanism augments the percentage of requests with guaranteed response time, thereby enhancing the Quality of Service of geographically distributed Web sites. However, HTTP request redirection should be used selectively because the additional round-trip increases network impact on latency time experienced by users. As a further contribution, this paper proposes and compares various mechanisms to limit reassignments with no negative consequences on load balancing."
121,"Traditional version vectors can be used to optimize peer-to-peer synchronization for pervasive computing devices. However, their storage overhead may be a prohibitive factor in scalability in an environment with typically low communication bandwidth and relatively small storage memory. We present a dynamic version vector design that allows small data sizes for version vector items. We call it lightweight version vector approach (LVV) and argue that a step-increase method of LVV can be an effective solution for peer-to-peer synchronization of pervasive computing devices."
122,"This paper studies workfile disk management for concurrent mergesorts ina multiprocessor database system. Specifically, we examine the impacts of workfile disk allocation and data striping on the average mergesort response time. Concurrent mergesorts in a multiprocessor system can creat severe I/O interference in which a large number of sequential write requests are continuously issued to the same workfile disk and block other read requests for a long period of time. We examine through detailed simulations a logical partitioning approach to workfile disk management and evaluate the effectiveness of datastriping. The results show that (1) without data striping, the best performance is achieved by using the entire workfile disks as a single partition if there are abundant workfile disks (or system workload is light); (2) however, if there are limited workfile disks (or system workload is heavy), the workfile disks should be partitioned into multiple groups and the optimal partition size is workload dependent; (3) data striping is beneficial only if the striping unit size is properly chosen; and (4) with a proper striping size, the best performance is generally achieved by using the entire disks as a single logical partition."
123,"High dimensional data has always been a challenge for clustering algorithms because of the inherent sparsity of the points. Recent research results indicate that in high dimensional data, even the concept of proximity or clustering may not be meaningful. We discuss very general techniques for projected clustering which are able to construct clusters in arbitrarily aligned subspaces of lower dimensionality. The subspaces are specific to the clusters themselves. This definition is substantially more general and realistic than currently available techniques which limit the method to only projections from the original set of attributes. The generalized projected clustering technique may also be viewed as a way of trying to redefine clustering for high dimensional applications by searching for hidden subspaces with clusters which are created by inter-attribute correlations. We provide a new concept of using extended cluster feature vectors in order to make the algorithm scalable for very large databases. The running time and space requirements of the algorithm are adjustable, and are likely ta tradeoff with better accuracy."

125,"Many diverse small devices, such as smart phones and personal digital assistants, are being deployed to access the Internet. Small devices typically have limited display and processing capabilities. It is thus difficult to effectively present a large table of information on these different devices such that the users can easily browse the table.In this paper, we present the design and prototype implementation of TabSum, a flexible and dynamic table summarization approach to reducing tables into smaller but still meaningful representations for various devices. TabSum supports easy browsing of a large table by various devices and provides personalization by taking into account both device capabilities and user preferences. A multi-source multi-layered specification methodology is proposed to describe summarization rules preferred by various sources. Upon requests, a set of table reduction rules is dynamically applied to the rows and columns of a table to reduce its size. The approach is flexible and dynamic. It summarizes both numeric and non-numeric data types."
126,"In this paper, we examine the issue of robust transaction routing in distributed database systems. A class of dynamic routing strategies which use estimated response times to make routing decisions is studied in details. Since response time estimation and decision making depend on the assumed transaction model and parameters, it is important to examine the robustness or sensitivity to the inaccuracy in the assumptions and parameter values. Through simulations, we find that the dynamic routing strategy based strictly on response time is too aggressive in sharing loads and makes too many non-preferred system routings. It is robust with respect to change in the number of database calls per transaction, but is relatively sensitive to the distribution of database calls. Two refinements are proposed which improve system performance as well as robustness of routing decisions."
127,"Skew in the distribution of values taken by an attribute is identified as a major factor that can affect the performance of parallel architectures for relational joins. The effect of skew on the performance of two parallel architectures is evaluated using analytic models. In one architecture, called database machine (DBMC), data as well as processing power are distributed; while in the other architecture, called Single Processor Parallel Input/output (SPPI), data is distributed but the processing power is concentrated in one processor. The two architectures are compared in terms of the ratio of MIPS used by DBMC and SPPI to deliver the same throughput and response time. In addition, the horizontal growth potential of DBMC is evaluated in terms of maximum speedup achievable by DBMC relative to SPPI response time. The MIPS ratio as well as speedup are found to be very sensitive to the amount of skew. These suggest, careful thought should be given in parallelizing database applications and in the design of algorithms and query optimizer for parallel architectures."
