1,"Graphs have become increasingly important in modelling complicated structures and schemaless data such as chemical compounds, proteins, and XML documents. Given a graph query, it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via indices. In this article, we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel indexing model based on discriminative frequent structures that are identified through a graph mining process. We show that the compact index built under this model can achieve better performance in processing graph queries. Since discriminative frequent structures capture the intrinsic characteristics of the data, they are relatively stable to database updates, thus facilitating sampling-based feature extraction and incremental index maintenance. Our approach not only provides an elegant solution to the graph indexing problem, but also demonstrates how database indexing and query processing can benefit from data mining, especially frequent pattern mining. Furthermore, the concepts developed here can be generalized and applied to indexing sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well."
2,"We propose a novel document clustering method which aims to cluster the documents into different semantic classes. The document space is generally of high dimensionality and clustering in such a high dimensional space is often infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. By using Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI), the documents can be projected into a lower-dimensional semantic space in which the documents related to the same semantics are close to each other. Different from previous document clustering methods based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) or Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), our method tries to discover both the geometric and discriminating structures of the document space. Theoretical analysis of our method shows that LPI is an unsupervised approximation of the supervised Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method, which gives the intuitive motivation of our method. Extensive experimental evaluations are performed on the Reuters-21578 and TDT2 data sets."
3,"We consider the problem of image representation and clustering. Traditionally, an n1 x n2 image is represented by a vector in the Euclidean space ℝ n1 x n2. Some learning algorithms are then applied to these vectors in such a high dimensional space for dimensionality reduction, classification, and clustering. However, an image is intrinsically a matrix, or the second order tensor. The vector representation of the images ignores the spatial relationships between the pixels in an image. In this paper, we introduce a tensor framework for image analysis. We represent the images as points in the tensor space Rn1 mathcal Rn2 which is a tensor product of two vector spaces. Based on the tensor representation, we propose a novel image representation and clustering algorithm which explicitly considers the manifold structure of the tensor space. By preserving the local structure of the data manifold, we can obtain a tensor subspace which is optimal for data representation in the sense of local isometry. We call it TensorImage approach. Traditional clustering algorithm such as k-means is then applied in the tensor subspace. Our algorithm shares many of the data representation and clustering properties of other techniques such as Locality Preserving Projections, Laplacian Eigenmaps, and spectral clustering, yet our algorithm is much more computationally efficient. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm."
4,"Support vector machines (SVMs) have been promising methods for classification and regression analysis due to their solid mathematical foundations, which include two desirable properties: margin maximization and nonlinear classification using kernels. However, despite these prominent properties, SVMs are usually not chosen for large-scale data mining problems because their training complexity is highly dependent on the data set size. Unlike traditional pattern recognition and machine learning, real-world data mining applications often involve huge numbers of data records. Thus it is too expensive to perform multiple scans on the entire data set, and it is also infeasible to put the data set in memory. This paper presents a method,  Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM) , that maximizes the SVM performance for very large data sets given a limited amount of resource, e.g., memory. CB-SVM applies a hierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide an SVM with high quality samples. These samples carry statistical summaries of the data and maximize the benefit of learning. Our analyses show that the training complexity of CB-SVM is quadratically dependent on the number of support vectors, which is usually much less than that of the entire data set. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that CB-SVM is highly scalable for very large data sets and very accurate in terms of classification."
5,"Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Community mining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Most of the existing methods on community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network, and moreover, the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However, in reality, there exist multiple, heterogeneous social networks, each representing a particular kind of relationship, and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task. In this paper, we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities on heterogeneous social networks. Based on the observation that different relations have different importance with respect to a certain query, we propose a new method for learning an optimal linear combination of these relations which can best meet the user's expectation. With the obtained relation, better performance can be achieved for community mining."
6,"With the fast expansion of computer networks, it is inevitable to study data mining on heterogeneous databases. In this paper we propose MDBM, an accurate and efficient approach for classification on multiple heterogeneous databases. We propose a regression-based method for predicting the usefulness of inter-database links that serve as bridges for information transfer, because such links are automatically detected and may or may not be useful or even valid. Because of the high cost of inter-database communication, MDBM employs a new strategy for cross-database classification, which finds and performs actions with high benefit-to-cost ratios. The experiments show that MDBM achieves high accuracy in cross-database classification, with much higher efficiency than previous approaches."
7,"Existing methods for top-k ranked query employ techniques including sorting, updating thresholds and materializing views. In this paper, we propose two novel index-based techniques for top-k ranked query: (1) indexing the layered skyline, and (2) indexing microclusters of objects into a grid structure. We also develop efficient algorithms for ranked query by locating the answer points during the sweeping of the line/hyperplane of the score function over the indexed objects. Both methods can be easily plugged into typical multi-dimensional database indexes. The comprehensive experiments not only demonstrate that our methods outperform the existing ones, but also illustrate that the application of data mining technique (microclustering) is a useful and effective solution for database query processing."
8,"Real-time surveillance systems, telecommunication systems, and other dynamic environments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to be scanned multiple times. Much of such data resides at rather low level of abstraction, whereas most analysts are interested in relatively high-level dynamic changes (such as trends and outliers). To discover such high-level characteristics, one may need to perform on-line multi-level, multi-dimensional analytical processing of stream data. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called stream_cube, to facilitate on-line, multi-dimensional, multi-level analysis of stream data."
9,"Automated localization of software bugs is one of the essential issues in debugging aids. Previous studies indicated that the evaluation history of program predicates may disclose important clues about underlying bugs. In this paper, we propose a new statistical model-based approach, called SOBER, which localizes software bugs without any prior knowledge of program semantics. Unlike existing statistical debugging approaches that select predicates correlated with program failures, SOBER models evaluation patterns of predicates in both correct and incorrect runs respectively and regards a predicate as bug-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrect runs differs significantly from that in correct ones. SOBER features a principled quantification of the pattern difference that measures the bug-relevance of program predicates.We systematically evaluated our approach under the same setting as previous studies. The result demonstrated the power of our approach in bug localization: SOBER can help programmers locate 68 out of 130 bugs in the Siemens suite when programmers are expected to examine no more than 10% of the code, whereas the best previously reported is 52 out of 130. Moreover, with the assistance of SOBER, we found two bugs in bc 1.06 (an arbitrary precision calculator on UNIX/Linux), one of which has never been reported before."
10,"A major challenge in frequent-pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results. In many cases, a high min_sup threshold may discover only commonsense patterns but a low one may generate an explosive number of output patterns, which severely restricts its usage.In this paper, we study the problem of compressing frequent-pattern sets. Typically, frequent patterns can be clustered with a tightness measure δ (called δ-cluster), and a representative pattern can be selected for each cluster. Unfortunately, finding a minimum set of representative patterns is NP-Hard. We develop two greedy methods, RPglobal and RPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compression bound but higher computational complexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds but is far more efficient. Our performance study shows that the compression quality using RPlocal is very close to RPglobal, and both can reduce the number of closed frequent patterns by almost two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, RPlocal mines even faster than FPClose[11], a very fast closed frequent-pattern mining method. We also show that RPglobal and RPlocal can be combined together to balance the quality and efficiency."
11,"Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Community mining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Most of the existing methods on community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network, and moreover, the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However, in reality, there exist multiple, heterogeneous social networks, each representing a particular kind of relationship, and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task. Thus mining networks by assuming only one kind of relation may miss a lot of valuable hidden community information and may not be adaptable to the diverse information needs from different users.In this paper, we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities on heterogeneous social networks. Based on the observation that different relations have different importance with respect to a certain query, we propose a new method for learning an optimal linear combination of these relations which can best meet the user's expectation. With the obtained relation, better performance can be achieved for community mining. Our approach to social network analysis and community mining represents a major shift in methodology from the traditional one, a shift from single-network, user-independent analysis to multi-network, user-dependant, and query-based analysis. Experimental results on Iris data set and DBLP data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
12,"As a potential alternative to current wet-lab technologies, DNA sequencing-by-hybridization (SBH) has received much attention from different research communities. In order to deal with real applications, experiment environments should not be considered as error-free. Previously, under the assumption of random independent hybridization errors, Leong et al. [9] presented an algorithm for sequence reconstruction which exhibits graceful degradation of output accuracy as the error rate increases. However, as the authors also admitted, a notable downside of their method is its too high computational cost. In this paper, we show that the poor efficiency of [9] is due to its mixing-up of situations with widely different characteristics and treating everything in the safest but also slowest way. Our new algorithm addresses this problem and pushes analysis down to a finer level where a more effective solution is proposed. As demonstrated by experimentations on real human genome datasets, this new methodology yields significant performance improvements and at the same time guarantees almost the same degree of output accuracy."
13,"Classification is one of the most popular data mining tasks with a wide range of applications, and lots of algorithms have been proposed to build accurate and scalable classifiers. Most of these algorithms only take a single table as input, whereas in the real world most data are stored in multiple tables and managed by relational database systems. As transferring data from multiple tables into a single one usually causes many problems, development of multi-relational classification algorithms becomes important and attracts many researchers' interests. Existing works about extending Naïve Bayes to deal with multi-relational data either have to transform data stored in tables to main-memory Prolog facts, or limit the search space to only a small subset of real world applications. In this work, we aim at solving these problems and building an efficient, accurate Naïve Bayesian classifier to deal with data in multiple tables directly. We propose an algorithm named Graph-NB, which upgrades Naïve Bayesian classifier to deal with multiple tables directly. In order to take advantage of linkage relationships among tables, and treat different tables linked to the target table differently, a semantic relationship graph is developed to describe the relationship and to avoid unnecessary joins. Furthermore, to improve accuracy, a pruning strategy is given to simplify the graph to avoid examining too many weakly linked tables. Experimental study on both real-world and synthetic databases shows its high efficiency and good accuracy."
14,"Discovery of sequential patterns is an essential data mining task with broad applications. Among several variations of sequential patterns, closed sequential pattern is the most useful one since it retains all the information of the complete pattern set but is often much more compact than it. Unfortunately, there is no parallel closed sequential pattern mining method proposed yet. In this paper we develop an algorithm, called Par-CSP (Parallel Closed Sequential Pattern mining), to conduct parallel mining of closed sequential patterns on a distributed memory system. Par-CSP partitions the work among the processors by exploiting the divide-and-conquer property so that the overhead of interprocessor communication is minimized. Par-CSP applies dynamic scheduling to avoid processor idling. Moreover, it employs a technique, called selective sampling to address the load imbalance problem. We implement Par-CSP using MPI on a 64-node Linux cluster. Our experimental results show that Par-CSP attains good parallelization efficiencies on various input datasets."
15,"Clustering is an essential data mining task with numerous applications. However, data in most real-life applications are high-dimensional in nature, and the related information often spreads across multiple relations. To ensure effective and efficient high-dimensional, cross-relational clustering, we propose a new approach, called CrossClus, which performs cross-relational clustering with user's guidance. We believe that user's guidance, even likely in very simple forms, could be essential for effective high-dimensional clustering since a user knows well the application requirements and data semantics. CrossClus is carried out as follows: A user specifies a clustering task and selects one or a small set of features pertinent to the task. CrossClus extracts the set of highly relevant features in multiple relations connected via linkages defined in the database schema, evaluates their effectiveness based on user's guidance, and identifies interesting clusters that fit user's needs. This method takes care of both quality in feature extraction and efficiency in clustering. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this approach."
16,"Relational graphs are widely used in modeling large scale networks such as biological networks and social networks. In this kind of graph, connectivity becomes critical in identifying highly associated groups and clusters. In this paper, we investigate the issues of mining closed frequent graphs with connectivity constraints in massive relational graphs where each graph has around 10K nodes and 1M edges. We adopt the concept of edge connectivity and apply the results from graph theory, to speed up the mining process. Two approaches are developed to handle different mining requests: CloseCut, a pattern-growth approach, and splat, a pattern-reduction approach. We have applied these methods in biological datasets and found the discovered patterns interesting."
17,"Frequent-pattern mining has been studied extensively on scalable methods for mining various kinds of patterns including itemsets, sequences, and graphs. However, the bottleneck of frequent-pattern mining is not at the efficiency but at the interpretability, due to the huge number of patterns generated by the mining process.In this paper, we examine how to summarize a collection of itemset patterns using only K representatives, a small number of patterns that a user can handle easily. The K representatives should not only cover most of the frequent patterns but also approximate their supports. A generative model is built to extract and profile these representatives, under which the supports of the patterns can be easily recovered without consulting the original dataset. Based on the restoration error, we propose a quality measure function to determine the optimal value of parameter K. Polynomial time algorithms are developed together with several optimization heuristics for efficiency improvement. Empirical studies indicate that we can obtain compact summarization in real datasets."
18,"The goal of data mining algorithm is to discover useful information embedded in large databases. Frequent itemset mining and sequential pattern mining are two important data mining problems with broad applications. Perhaps the most efficient way to solve these problems sequentially is to apply a pattern-growth algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm [9, 10]. In this paper, we present a framework for parallel mining frequent itemsets and sequential patterns based on the divide-and-conquer strategy of pattern growth. Then, we discuss the load balancing problem and introduce a sampling technique, called selective sampling, to address this problem. We implemented parallel versions of both frequent itemsets and sequential pattern mining algorithms following our framework. The experimental results show that our parallel algorithms usually achieve excellent speedups."
19,"Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an important research problem with broad applications. Recently, we developed an effective index structure, ADI, and efficient algorithms for mining frequent patterns from large, disk-based graph databases [5], as well as constraint-based mining techniques. The techniques have been integrated into a research prototype system--- GraphMiner. In this paper, we describe a demo of GraphMiner which showcases the technical details of the index structure and the mining algorithms including their efficient implementation, the mining performance and the comparison with some state-of-the-art methods, the constraint-based graph-pattern mining techniques and the procedure of constrained graph mining, as well as mining real data sets in novel applications."
20,"Advanced database systems face a great challenge raised by the emergence of massive, complex structural data in bioinformatics, chem-informatics, and many other applications. The most fundamental support needed in these applications is the efficient search of complex structured data. Since exact matching is often too restrictive, similarity search of complex structures becomes a vital operation that must be supported efficiently.In this paper, we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed missing features, our structural filtering algorithm, called Grafil, can filter many graphs without performing pairwise similarity computations. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature set selection strategy for filtering. By examining the effect of different feature selection mechanisms, we develop a multi-filter composition strategy, where each filter uses a distinct and complementary subset of the features. We identify the criteria to form effective feature sets for filtering, and demonstrate that combining features with similar size and selectivity can improve the filtering and search performance significantly. Moreover, the concept presented in Grafil can be applied to searching approximate non-consecutive sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well."
21,"Sequential pattern mining has been studied extensively in the data mining community. Most previous studies require the specification of a min_support threshold for mining a complete set of sequential patterns satisfying the threshold. However, in practice, it is difficult for users to provide an appropriate min_support threshold. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed sequential patterns of length no less than min_ℓ, where k is the desired number of closed sequential patterns to be mined and min_ℓ is the minimal length of each pattern. We mine the set of closed patterns because it is a compact representation of the complete set of frequent patterns. An efficient algorithm, called TSP, is developed for mining such patterns without min_support. Starting at (absolute) min_support=1, the algorithm makes use of the length constraint and the properties of top-k closed sequential patterns to perform dynamic support raising and projected database pruning. Our extensive performance study shows that TSP has high performance. In most cases, it outperforms the efficient closed sequential pattern-mining algorithm, CloSpan, even when the latter is running with the best tuned min_support threshold. Thus, we conclude that, for sequential pattern mining, mining top-k frequent closed sequential patterns without min_support is more preferable than the traditional min_support-based mining."

23,"Frequent itemset mining has been studied extensively in literature. Most previous studies require the specification of a min_support threshold and aim at mining a complete set of frequent itemsets satisfying min_support. However, in practice, it is difficult for users to provide an appropriate min_support threshold. In addition, a complete set of frequent itemsets is much less compact than a set of frequent closed itemsets. In this paper, we propose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed itemsets of length no less than min_l, where k is the desired number of frequent closed itemsets to be mined, and min_l is the minimal length of each itemset. An efficient algorithm, called TFP, is developed for mining such itemsets without mins_support. Starting at min_support = 0 and by making use of the length constraint and the properties of top-k frequent closed itemsets, min_support can be raised effectively and FP-Tree can be pruned dynamically both during and after the construction of the tree using our two proposed methods: the closed node count and descendant_sum. Moreover, mining is further speeded up by employing a top-down and bottom-up combined FP-Tree traversing strategy, a set of search space pruning methods, a fast 2-level hash-indexed result tree, and a novel closed itemset verification scheme. Our extensive performance study shows that TFP has high performance and linear scalability in terms of the database size."
24,"Previous work on mining transactional database has focused primarily on mining frequent itemsets, association rules, and sequential patterns. However, interesting relationships between customers and items, especially their evolution with time, have not been studied thoroughly. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian transformation-based regression model that captures time-variant relationships between customers and products. Moreover, since it is interesting to discover such relationships in a multi-dimensional space, an efficient method has been developed to compute multi-dimensional aggregates of such curves in a data cube environment. Our experimental results have demonstrated the promise of the approach."
25,"The iceberg cube mining computes all cells v, corresponding to GROUP BY partitions, that satisfy a given constraint on aggregated behaviors of the tuples in a GROUP BY partition. The number of cells often is so large that the result cannot be realistically searched without pushing the constraint into the search. Previous works have pushed antimonotone and monotone constraints. However, many useful constraints are neither antimonotone nor monotone. We consider a general class of aggregate constraints of the form f(v)\theta \sigma, where f is an arithmetic function of SQL-like aggregates and \theta is one of <,\leq,\geq,>. We propose a novel pushing technique, called Divide-and-Approximate, to push such constraints. The idea is to recursively divide the search space and approximate the given constraint using antimonotone or monotone constraints in subspaces. This technique applies to a class called separable constraints, which properly contains all constraints built by an arithmetic function f of all SQL aggregates."
26,"  Motivation:  The rapid accumulation of biological network data translates into an urgent need for computational methods for graph pattern mining. One important problem is to identify recurrent patterns across multiple networks to discover biological modules. However, existing algorithms for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time and space as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently, no efficient algorithm is available for mining recurrent patterns across large collections of genome-wide networks."
27,"A topic directory, e.g., Yahoo directory, provides a view of a document set at different levelsof abstraction and is ideal for the interactive exploration and visualization of the document set. We present a method that dynamically generates a topic directory from a document set usinga frequent closed termset mining algorithm. Our method shows experimental results of equal quality to recent document clustering methods and has additional benefits such as automatic generation of topic labels and determination of a clustering parameter."
28,"Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. However, it is also a difficult problem since the mining may have to generate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. Most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods, such as GSP, explore a candidate generation-and-test approach [1] to reduce the number of candidates to be examined. However, this approach may not be efficient in mining large sequence databases having numerous patterns and/or long patterns. In this paper, we propose a projection-based, sequential pattern-growth approach for efficient mining of sequential patterns. In this approach, a sequence database is recursively projected into a set of smaller projected databases, and sequential patterns are grown in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent fragments. Based on an initial study of the pattern growth-based sequential pattern mining, FreeSpan [8], we propose a more efficient method, called PSP, which offers ordered growth and reduced projected databases. To further improve the performance, a pseudoprojection technique is developed in PrefixSpan. A comprehensive performance study shows that PrefixSpan, in most cases, outperforms the a priori-based algorithm GSP, FreeSpan, and SPADE [29] (a sequential pattern mining algorithm that adopts vertical data format), and PrefixSpan integrated with pseudoprojection is the fastest among all the tested algorithms. Furthermore, this mining methodology can be extended to mining sequential patterns with user-specified constraints. The high promise of the pattern-growth approach may lead to its further extension toward efficient mining of other kinds of frequent patterns, such as frequent substructures."
29,"People recently are interested in a new operator, called skyline [3], which returns the objects that are not dominated by any other objects with regard to certain measures in a multi-dimensional space. Recent work on the skyline operator [3,15,8,13,2] focuses on efficient computation of skylines in large databases. However, such work gives users only thin skylines, i.e., single objects, which may not be desirable in some real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, called thick skyline, which recommends not only skyline objects but also their nearby neighbors within -distance. Efficient computation methods are developed including (1) two efficient algorithms, Sampling-and-Pruning and Indexing-and-Estimating, to find such thick skyline with the help of statistics or indexes in large databases, and (2) a highly efficient Microcluster-based algorithm for mining thick skyline. The Microcluster-based method not only leads to substantial savings in computation but also provides a cocise representation of the thick skyline in the case of high cardinalities. Our experimental performance study shows that the proposed methods are both efficient and effective."
30,"Frequent-pattern mining has been studied extensively and has many useful applications. However, frequent-pattern mining often generates too many patterns to be truly efficient or effective. In many applications, it is sufficient to generate and examine frequent patterns with a sufficiently good approximation of the support frequency instead of in full precision. Such a compact but "close-enough" frequent-pattern base is called a condensed frequent-pattern base.In this paper, we propose and examine several alternatives for the design, representation, and implementation of such condensed frequent-pattern bases. Several algorithms for computing such pattern bases are proposed. Their effectiveness at pattern compression and methods for efficiently computing them are investigated. A systematic performance study is conducted on different kinds of databases, and demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in handling frequent-pattern mining in large databases."
31,"The data stream problem has been studied extensively in recent years, because of the great ease in collection of stream data. The nature of stream data makes it essential to use algorithms which require only one pass over the data. Recently, single-scan, stream analysis methods have been proposed in this context. However, a lot of stream data is high-dimensional in nature. High-dimensional data is inherently more complex in clustering, classification, and similarity search. Recent research discusses methods for projected clustering over high-dimensional data sets. This method is however difficult to generalize to data streams because of the complexity of the method and the large volume of the data streams."
32,"Data cube has been playing an essential role in fast OLAP (online analytical processing) in many multi-dimensional data warehouses. However, there exist data sets in applications like bioinformatics, statistics, and text processing that are characterized by high dimensionality, e.g., over 100 dimensions, and moderate size, e.g., around 106 tuples. No feasible data cube can be constructed with such data sets. In this paper we will address the problem of developing an efficient algorithm to perform OLAP on such data sets."
33,"Many real-world graphs have been shown to be scale-free---vertex degrees follow power law distributions, vertices tend to cluster, and the average length of all shortest paths is small. We present a new model for understanding scale-free networks based on multilevel geodesic approximation, using a new data structure called a multilevel mesh.Using this multilevel framework, we propose a new kind of graph clustering for data reduction of very large graph systems such as social, biological, or electronic networks. Finally, we apply our algorithms to real-world social networks and protein interaction graphs to show that they can reveal knowledge embedded in underlying graph structures. We also demonstrate how our data structures can be used to quickly answer approximate distance and shortest path queries on scale-free networks."
34,"Due to the advances in positioning technologies, the real time information of moving objects becomes increasingly available, which has posed new challenges to the database research. As a long-standing technique to identify overall distribution patterns in data, clustering has achieved brilliant successes in analyzing static datasets. In this paper, we study the problem of clustering moving objects, which could catch interesting pattern changes during the motion process and provide better insight into the essence of the mobile data points. In order to catch the spatial-temporal regularities of moving objects and handle large amounts of data, micro-clustering [20] is employed. Efficient techniques are proposed to keep the moving micro-clusters geographically small. Important events such as the collisions among moving micro-clusters are also identified. In this way, high quality moving micro-clusters are dynamically maintained, which leads to fast and competitive clustering result at any given time instance. We validate our approaches with a through experimental evaluation, where orders of magnitude improvement on running time is observed over normal K-Means clustering method [14]."
35,"Many real life sequence databases grow incrementally. It is undesirable to mine sequential patterns from scratch each time when a small set of sequences grow, or when some new sequences are added into the database. Incremental algorithm should be developed for sequential pattern mining so that mining can be adapted to incremental database updates. However, it is nontrivial to mine sequential patterns incrementally, especially when the existing sequences grow incrementally because such growth may lead to the generation of many new patterns due to the interactions of the growing subsequences with the original ones. In this study, we develop an efficient algorithm, IncSpan, for incremental mining of sequential patterns, by exploring some interesting properties. Our performance study shows that IncSpan outperforms some previously proposed incremental algorithms as well as a non-incremental one with a wide margin."
36,"Current models of the classification problem do not effectively handle bursts of particular classes coming in at different times. In fact, the current model of the classification problem simply concentrates on methods for one-pass classification modeling of very large data sets. Our model for data stream classification views the data stream classification problem from the point of view of a dynamic approach in which simultaneous training and testing streams are used for dynamic classification of data sets. This model reflects real life situations effectively, since it is desirable to classify test streams in real time over an evolving training and test stream. The aim here is to create a classification system in which the training model can adapt quickly to the changes of the underlying data stream. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an on-demand classification process which can dynamically select the appropriate window of past training data to build the classifier. The empirical results indicate that the system maintains a high classification accuracy in an evolving data stream, while providing an efficient solution to the classification task."
37,"To enable information integration, schema matching is a critical step for discovering semantic correspondences of attributes across heterogeneous sources. While complex matchings are common, because of their far more complex search space, most existing techniques focus on simple 1:1 matchings. To tackle this challenge, this paper takes a conceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining, for our task of matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet. On this "deep Web," query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups (e.g., [author] corresponds to [first name, last name] in the Books domain). We observe that the co-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semantic relationships: grouping attributes (e.g., [first name, last name]) tend to be co-present in query interfaces and thus positively correlated. In contrast, synonym attributes are negatively correlated because they rarely co-occur. This insight enables us to discover complex matchings by a correlation mining approach. In particular, we develop the DCM framework, which consists of data preparation, dual mining of positive and negative correlations, and finally matching selection. Unlike previous correlation mining algorithms, which mainly focus on finding strong positive correlations, our algorithm cares both positive and negative correlations, especially the subtlety of negative correlations, due to its special importance in schema matching. This leads to the introduction of a new correlation measure, $H$-measure, distinct from those proposed in previous work. We evaluate our approach extensively and the results show good accuracy for discovering complex matchings."
38,"Many data analysis tasks can be viewed as search or mining in a multidimensional space (MDS). In such MDSs, dimensions capture potentially important factors for given applications, and cells represent combinations of values for the factors. To systematically analyze data in MDS, an interesting notion, called "cubegrade was recently introduced by Imielinski et al. [CHECK END OF SENTENCE], which focuses on the notable changes in measures in MDS by comparing a cell (which we refer to as probe cell) with its gradient cells, namely, its ancestors, descendants, and siblings. We call such queries gradient analysis queries (GQs). Since an MDS can contain billions of cells, it is important to answer GQs efficiently. In this study, we focus on developing efficient methods for mining GQs constrained by certain (weakly) antimonotone constraints. Instead of conducting an independent gradient-cell search once per probe cell, which is inefficient due to much repeated work, we propose an efficient algorithm, LiveSet-Driven. This algorithm finds all good gradient-probe cell pairs in one search pass. It utilizes measure-value analysis and dimension-match analysis in a set-oriented manner, to achieve bidirectional pruning between the sets of hopeful probe cells and of hopeful gradient cells. Moreover, it adopts a hypertree structure and an H-cubing method to compress data and to maximize sharing of computation. Our performance study shows that this algorithm is efficient and scalable. In addition to data cubes, we extend our study to another important scenario: mining constrained gradients in transactional databases where each item is associated with some measures such as price. Such transactional databases can be viewed as sparse MDSs where items represent dimensions, although they have significantly different characteristics than data cubes. We outline efficient mining methods for this problem in this paper."
39,"The data cube and iceberg cube computation problemhas been studied by many researchers. There are three majorapproaches developed in this direction: (1) top-downcomputation, represented by MultiWay array aggregation[An Array-Based Algorithm for Simultaneous Multidimensional Aggregates], which utilizes shared computation and performs wellon dense data sets; (2) bottom-up computation, representedby BUC [Bottom-up computation of sparse and iceberg cubes], which takes advantage of Apriori Pruning and performs well on sparse data sets; and (3) integratedtop-down and bottom-up computation, represented by Star-Cubing[Computing Iceberg Cubes by Top-Down and Bottom-Up Integration], which takes advantages of both and has high performance in most cases. However, the performance ofStar-Cubing degrades in very sparse data sets due to theadditional cost introduced by the tree structure. None of thethree approaches achieves uniformly high performance onall kinds of data sets.In this paper, we present a new approach that computeIceberg Cubes by factorizing the lattice space accordingto the frequency of values. This approach, different fromall the previous dimension-based approaches where the importanceof data distribution is not recognized, partitionsthe cube lattice into one dense subspace and several sparsesubspaces. With this approach, a new method called MM-Cubinghas been developed. MM-Cubing is highly adaptiveto dense, sparse or skewed data sets. Our performancestudy shows that MM-Cubing is efficient and achieves highperformance over all kinds of data distributions."
40,"The paper describes a new method of continuously monitoringthe k nearest neighbors of a given object in the mobileenvironment.Instead of monitoring all k nearest neighbors,we choose to monitor the k-th (nearest) neighbor sincethe necessary condition of changes in the KNN is the changeof the k-th neighbor.In addition, rather than in the originalspace, we consider the moving objects in a transformedtime-distance (TD) space, where each object is representedby a curve.A beach-line algorithm is developed to monitorthe change of the k-th neighbor, which enables us to maintainthe KNN incrementally.An extensive empirical studyshows that the beach-line algorithm outperforms the mostefficient existing algorithm by a wide margin, especiallywhen k or n (the total number of objects) is large."
41,"To enable information integration, schema matching is a critical step for discovering semantic correspondences of attributes across heterogeneous sourcess. As a new attempt, this paper studies such matching as a data mining problem. Specifically, while complex matchings are common, because of their far more complex search space, most existing techniques focus on simple 1:1 matchings. To tackle this challenge, this paper takes a conceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining, for our task of matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet. On this "deep Web," query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups (e.g., {author} corresponds to {first name, last name} in the Books domain). We observe that the co-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semantic relationships: grouping attributes (e.g., {first name, last name}) tend to be co-present in query interfaces and thus positively correlated. In contrast, synonym attributes are negatively correlated because they rarely co-occur. This insight enables us to discover complex matchings by a correlation mining approach, which consists of dual mining of positive and negative correlations. We evaluate our approach on deep Web sources in several object domains (e.g., Books and Airfares) and the results show that the correlation mining approach does discover semantically meaningful matchings among attributes."
42,"Graph has become increasingly important in modelling complicated structures and schemaless data such as proteins, chemical compounds, and XML documents. Given a graph query, it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via graph-based indices. In this paper, we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel solution by applying a graph mining technique. Different from the existing path-based methods, our approach, called gIndex, makes use of frequent substructure as the basic indexing feature. Frequent substructures are ideal candidates since they explore the intrinsic characteristics of the data and are relatively stable to database updates. To reduce the size of index structure, two techniques, size-increasing support constraint and discriminative fragments, are introduced. Our performance study shows that gIndex has 10 times smaller index size, but achieves 3--10 times better performance in comparison with a typical path-based method, GraphGrep. The gIndex approach not only provides and elegant solution to the graph indexing problem, but also demonstrates how database indexing and query processing can benefit form data mining, especially frequent pattern mining. Furthermore, the concepts developed here can be applied to indexing sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well."
43,"Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-based mining paradigm in the context of frequent itemsets, associations, correlations, sequential patterns, and many other interesting patterns in large databases. Constraint pushing techniques have been developed for mining frequent patterns and associations with antimonotonic, monotonic, and succinct constraints. In this paper, we study constraints which cannot be handled with existing theory and techniques in frequent pattern mining. For example, avg(S)θv, median(S)θv, sum(S)θv (S can contain items of arbitrary values, θ ∈ {>, <, ≤, ≥} and v is a real number.) are customarily regarded as “tough” constraints in that they cannot be pushed inside an algorithm such as Apriori. We develop a notion of convertible constraints and systematically analyze, classify, and characterize this class. We also develop techniques which enable them to be readily pushed deep inside the recently developed FP-growth algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Results from our detailed experiments show the effectiveness of the techniques developed."
44,"Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. However, it, is also a challenging problem since the mining may have to generate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. Recent studies have developed two major classes of sequential pattern mining methods: (1) a candidate generation-and-test approach, represented by (i) GSP, a horizontal format-based sequential pattern mining method, and (ii) SPADE, a vertical format-based method; and (2) a pattern-growth method, represented by PrefixSpan and its further extensions, such as gSpan for mining structured patterns.In this study, we perform a systematic introduction and presentation of the pattern-growth methodology and study its principles and extensions. We first introduce two interesting pattern-growth algorithms, FreeSpan mid PrefixSpan, for efficient sequential pattern mining. Then we introduce gSpan for mining structured patterns using the same methodology. Their relative performance in large databases is presented and analyzed. Several extensions of these methods are also discussed in the paper, including mining multi-level, multi-dimensional patterns and mining constraint-based patterns."
45,"Most of today's structured data is stored in relationaldatabases. Such a database consists of multiplerelations which are linked together conceptually viaentity-relationship links in the design of relational databaseschemas. Multi-relational classification can be widelyused in many disciplines, such as financial decision making,medical research, and geographical applications.However, most classification approaches only work on single"flat" data relations. It is usually difficult to convertmultiple relations into a single flat relation without eitherintroducing huge, undesirable "universal relation" orlosing essential information. Previous works using InductiveLogic Programming approaches (recently also knownas Relational Mining) have proven effective with high accuracyin multi-relational classification. Unfortunately,they suffer from poor scalability w.r.t. the number of relationsand the number of attributes in databases.In this paper we propose CrossMine, an efficientand scalable approach for multi-relational classification.Several novel methods are developed in CrossMine,including (1) tuple ID propagation, which performssemantics-preserving virtual join to achieve high efficiencyon databases with complex schemas, and (2) a selectivesampling method, which makes it highly scalablew.r.t. the number of tuples in the databases. Both theoreticalbackgrounds and implementation techniques ofCrossMine are introduced.

47,"Abstract--Web page classification is one of the essential techniques for Web mining because classifying Web pages of an interesting class is often the first step of mining the Web. However, constructing a classifier for an interesting class requires laborious pre-processing such as collecting positive and negative training examples. For instance, in order to construct a homepage classifier, one needs to collect a sample of homepages (positive examples) and a sample of nonhomepages (negative examples). In particular, collecting negative training examples requires arduous work and caution to avoid bias. This paper presents a framework, called Positive Example Based Learning (PEBL), for Web page classification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examples in preprocessing. The PEBL framework applies an algorithm, called Mapping-Convergence (M-C), to achieve high classification accuracy (with positive and unlabeled data) as high as that of a traditional SVM (with positive and negative data). M-C runs in two stages: the mapping stage and convergence stage. In the mapping stage, the algorithm uses a weak classifier that draws an initial approximation of strong negative data. Based on the initial approximation, the convergence stage iteratively runs an internal classifier (e.g., SVM) which maximizes margins to progressively improve the approximation of negative data. Thus, the class boundary eventually converges to the true boundary of the positive class in the feature space. We present the M-C algorithm with supporting theoretical and experimental justifications. Our experiments show that, given the same set of positive examples, the M-C algorithm outperforms one-class SVMs, and it is almost as accurate as the traditional SVMs."
48,"Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, time-series databases, and many other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist a large number of patterns and/or long patterns."
49,"Sequential pattern mining has been studied extensivelyin data mining community.Most previous studies requirethe specification of a minimum support threshold to performthe mining.However, it is difficult for users to providean appropriate threshold in practice.To overcomethis difficulty, we propose an alternative task: mining top-kfrequent closed sequential patterns of length no less thanmin_l, where k is the desired number of closed sequentialpatterns to be mined, and min_l is the minimum length ofeach pattern.We mine closed patterns since they are compactrepresentations of frequent patterns.We developed an efficient algorithm, called TSP, whichmakes use of the length constraint and the properties of top-kclosed sequential patterns to perform dynamic support-raisingand projected database-pruning.Our extensive performancestudy shows that TSP outperforms the closed sequentialpattern mining algorithm even when the latter isrunning with the best tuned minimum support threshold."
50,"Association rule mining often generates a huge numberof rules, but a majority of them either are redundantor don not reflect the tue correlation relationship amongdata objects.In this paper, we re-examine this problemand show that two interesting measures, all_confidence(denoted as \alpha) and coherence (denoted as \gamma), both disclosegenuine correlation relationships and can be computedefficiently.Moreover, we propose two interestingalgorithms, CoMine(\alpha) and CoMine(\gamma), based onextensions of a pattern-growth methodology.Our performancestudy shows that the CoMine algorithms havehigh performance in comparison with their Apriori-basedcounterpart algorithms."
51,"Most existing studies of text classification assume that the training data are completely labeled. In reality, however, many information retrieval problems can be more accurately described as learning a binary classifier from a set of incompletely labeled examples, where we typically have a small number of labeled positive examples and a very large number of unlabeled examples. In this paper, we study such a problem of performing Text Classification WithOut labeled Negative data TC-WON). In this paper, we explore an efficient extension of the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, called SVMC (Support Vector Mapping Convergence) [17]for the TC-WON tasks. Our analyses show that when the positive training data is not too under-sampled, SVMC significantly outperforms other methods because SVMC basically exploits the natural "gap" between positive and negative documents in the feature space, which eventually corresponds to improving the generalization performance. In the text domain there are likely to exist many gaps in the feature space because a document is usually mapped to a sparse and high dimensional feature space. However, as the number of positive training data decreases, the boundary of SVMC starts overfitting at some point and end up generating very poor results.This is because when the positive training data is too few, the boundary over-iterates and trespasses the natural gaps between positive and negative class in the feature space and thus ends up fitting tightly around the few positive training data."
52,"Data cube computation is one of the most essential but expensive operations in data warehousing. Previous studies have developed two major approaches, top-down vs. bottom-up. The former, represented by the Multi-Way Array Cube (called MultiWay) algorithm [25], aggregates simultaneously on multiple dimensions; however, it cannot take advantage of Apriori pruning [2] when computing iceberg cubes (cubes that contain only aggregate cells whose measure value satisfies a threshold, called iceberg condition). The latter, represented by two algorithms: BUC [6] and H-Cubing[11], computes the iceberg cube bottom-up and facilitates Apriori pruning. BUC explores fast sorting and partitioning techniques; whereas H-Cubing explores a data structure, H-Tree, for shared computation. However, none of them fully explores multi-dimensional simultaneous aggregation."
53,"The clustering problem is a difficult problem for the data stream domain. This is because the large volumes of data arriving in a stream renders most traditional algorithms too inefficient. In recent years, a few one-pass clustering algorithms have been developed for the data stream problem. Although such methods address the scalability issues of the clustering problem, they are generally blind to the evolution of the data and do not address the following issues: (1) The quality of the clusters is poor when the data evolves considerably over time. (2) A data stream clustering algorithm requires much greater functionality in discovering and exploring clusters over different portions of the stream."
54,"Object matching is a fundamental problem that arises in numerous information integration scenarios. Virtually all existing solutions assume that the objects to be matched share the same attribute set and that systems can match them by comparing attribute similarities. Our work addresses the more general problem in which objects also have disjoint attributes-for example, matching tuples from relational tables that have different schemas, such as (age, name) and (name, salary). Profile-Based Object Matching, which applies this idea, exploits disjoint attributes to improve matching accuracy. PROM first matches any two tuples based on a shared attribute, such as name. It then applies a set of profilers, each of which contains some knowledge about what constitutes a typical person. The profilers examine the tuple pair to see if it plausibly describes a person. A profiler might state, for example, that if the pair produces a person with an age of 6 and a salary of $100,000, the pair doesn't describe a real person, so the tuples don't match. Profilers can be manually specified by domain experts, trained on training data, transferred from other matching tasks, or built from external data. PROM is thus distinct in that it not only exploits disjoint attributes to improve matching accuracy but also facilitates knowledge reuse from previous object-matching tasks."
55,"Support vector machines (SVMs) have been promising methods for classification and regression analysis because of their solid mathematical foundations which convery several salient properties that other methods hardly provide. However, despite the prominent properties of SVMs, they are not as favored for large-scale data mining as for pattern recognition or machine learning because the training complexity of SVMs is highly dependent on the size of a data set. Many real-world data mining applications involve millions or billions of data records where even multiple scans of the entire data are too expensive to perform. This paper presents a new method, Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM), which is specifically designed for handling very large data sets. CB-SVM applies a hierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide an SVM with high quality samples that carry the statistical summaries of the data such that the summaries maximize the benefit of learning the SVM. CB-SVM tries to generate the best SVM boundary for very large data sets given limited amount of resources. Our experiments on synthetic and real data sets show that CB-SVM is highly scalable for very large data sets while also generating high classification accuracy."
56,"Recent research on pattern discovery has progressed form mining frequent itemsets and sequences to mining structured patterns including trees, lattices, and graphs. As a general data structure, graph can model complicated relations among data with wide applications in bioinformatics, Web exploration, and etc. However, mining large graph patterns in challenging due to the presence of an exponential number of frequent subgraphs. Instead of mining all the subgraphs, we propose to mine closed frequent graph patterns. A graph g is closed in a database if there exists no proper supergraph of g that has the same support as g. A closed graph pattern mining algorithm, CloseGraph, is developed by exploring several interesting pruning methods. Our performance study shows that CloseGraph not only dramatically reduces unnecessary subgraphs to be generated but also substantially increases the efficiency of mining, especially in the presence of large graph patterns."
57,"Mining frequent closed itemsets provides complete and non-redundant results for frequent pattern analysis. Extensive studies have proposed various strategies for efficient frequent closed itemset mining, such as depth-first search vs. breadthfirst search, vertical formats vs. horizontal formats, tree-structure vs. other data structures, top-down vs. bottom-up traversal, pseudo projection vs. physical projection of conditional database, etc. It is the right time to ask "what are the pros and cons of the strategies?" and "what and how can we pick and integrate the best strategies to achieve higher performance in general cases?"In this study, we answer the above questions by a systematic study of the search strategies and develop a winning algorithm CLOSET+. CLOSET+ integrates the advantages of the previously proposed effective strategies as well as some ones newly developed here. A thorough performance study on synthetic and real data sets has shown the advantages of the strategies and the improvement of CLOSET+ over existing mining algorithms, including CLOSET, CHARM and OP, in terms of runtime, memory usage and scalability."
58,"Recently, mining data streams with concept drifts for actionable insights has become an important and challenging task for a wide range of applications including credit card fraud protection, target marketing, network intrusion detection, etc. Conventional knowledge discovery tools are facing two challenges, the overwhelming volume of the streaming data, and the concept drifts. In this paper, we propose a general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams using weighted ensemble classifiers. We train an ensemble of classification models, such as C4.5, RIPPER, naive Beyesian, etc., from sequential chunks of the data stream. The classifiers in the ensemble are judiciously weighted based on their expected classification accuracy on the test data under the time-evolving environment. Thus, the ensemble approach improves both the efficiency in learning the model and the accuracy in performing classification. Our empirical study shows that the proposed methods have substantial advantage over single-classifier approaches in prediction accuracy, and the ensemble framework is effective for a variety of classification models."
59,"Nowadays, high throughput experimental techniques make it feasible to examine and collect massive dataat the molecular level.These data, typically mappedto a very high dimensional feature space, carry richinformation about functionalities of certain chemicalor biological entities and can be used to infer valuableknowledge for the purposes of classification and prediction.Typically, a small number of features or featurecombinations may play determinant roles in functionaldiscrimination.The identification of such features orfeature combinations is of great importance.In this paper,we study the problem of discovering compact andhighly discriminative features or feature combinationsfrom a rich feature collection.We employ the supportvector machine as the classification means and aim atfinding compact feature combinations.Comparing toprevious methods on feature selection, which identifyfeatures solely based on their individual roles in theclassification, our method is able to identify minimalfeature combinations that ultimately have determinantroles in a systematic fashion.Experimental study ondrug activity data shows that our method can discoverdescriptors that are not necessarily significant individuallybut are most significant collectively."
60,"The classification of different tumor types is of great importance in cancer diagnosis and drug discovery. However, most previous cancer classification studies are clinical based and have limited diagnostic ability. Cancer classification using gene expression data is known to contain the keys for addressing the fundamental problems relating to cancer diagnosis and drug discovery. The recent advent of DNA microarray technique has made simultaneous monitoring of thousands of gene expressions possible. With this abundance of gene expression data, researchers have started to explore the possibilities of cancer classification using gene expression data. Quite a number of methods have been proposed in recent years with promising results. But there are still a lot of issues which need to be addressed and understood.In order to gain a deep insight into the cancer classification problem, it is necessary to take a closer look at the problem, the proposed solutions and the related issues all together. In this survey paper, we present a comprehensive overview of various proposed cancer classification methods and evaluate them based on their computation time, classification accuracy and ability to reveal biologically meaningful gene information. We also introduce and evaluate various proposed gene selection methods which we believe should be an integral preprocessing step for cancer classification. In order to obtain a full picture of cancer classification, we also discuss several issues related to cancer classification, including the biological significance vs. statistical significance of a cancer classifier, the asymmetrical classification errors for cancer classifiers, and the gene contamination problem."
61,"Interesting patterns often occur at varied levels of support. The classic association mining based on a uniform minimum support, such as Apriori, either misses interesting patterns of low support or suffers from the bottleneck of itemset generation caused by a low minimum support. A better solution lies in exploiting support constraints, which specify what minimum support is required for what itemsets, so that only the necessary itemsets are generated. In this paper, we present a framework of frequent itemset mining in the presence of support constraints. Our approach is to push support constraints into the Apriori itemset generation so that the best minimum support is determined for each itemset at runtime to preserve the essence of Apriori. This strategy is called Adapative Apriori.Experiments show that Adapative Apriori is highly effective in dealing with the bottleneck of itemset generation."
62,"Most of the previous studies on mining association rules are on mining intratransaction associations, i.e., the associations among items within the same transaction where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer, the events happened on the same day, etc. In this study, we break the barrier of transactions and extend the scope of mining association rules from traditional single-dimensional, intratransaction associations to multidimensional, intertransaction associations. An intertransaction association describes the association relationships among different transactions. In a database of stock price information, an example of such an association is "if (company) A's stock goes up on day one, B's stock will go down on day two but go up on day four." In this case, no matter whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction, the associated items belong to different transactions. Moreover, such an intertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple properties in the same rule, so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can also be defined and discovered. Mining intertransaction associations pose more challenges on efficient processing than mining intratransaction associations because the number of potential association rules becomes extremely large after the boundary of transactions is broken. In this study, we introduce the notion of intertransaction association rule, define its measurements: support and confidence, and develop an efficient algorithm, FITI (an acronym for "First Intra Then Inter"), for mining intertransaction associations, which adopts two major ideas: 1) an intertransaction frequent itemset contains only the frequent itemsets of its corresponding intratransaction counterpart; and 2) a special data structure is built among intratransaction frequent itemsets for efficient mining of intertransaction frequent itemsets. We compare FITI with EH-Apriori, the best algorithm in our previous proposal, and demonstrate a substantial performance gain of FITI over EH-Apriori. Further extensions of the method and its implications are also discussed in the paper."
63,"We investigate new approaches for frequent graph-basedpattern mining in graph datasets and propose a novel algorithmcalled gSpan (graph-based Substructure pattern mining),which discovers frequent substructures without candidategeneration. gSpan builds a new lexicographic orderamong graphs, and maps each graph to a unique minimumDFS code as its canonical label. Based on this lexico-graphicorder, gSpan adopts the depth-first search strategyto mine frequent connected subgraphs efficiently. Our performancestudy shows that gSpan substantially outperformsprevious algorithms, sometimes by an order of magnitude."
64,"In this paper, we propose a new mining task: mining top-kfrequent closed patterns of length no less than min_l, wherek is the desired number of frequent closed patterns to bemined, and min _l is the minimal length of each pattern.An efficient algorithm, called TFP, is developed for mining such patterns without minimum support. Two methods, closed_node_count and descendant_sum are proposedto effiectively raise support threshold and prune FP-tree bothduring and after the construction of FP-tree. During themining process, a novel top-down and bottom-up combinedFP-tree mining strategy is developed to speed-up support-raising and closed frequent pattern discovering. In addition,a fast hash-based closed pattern verification scheme has beenemployed to check efficiently if a potential closed pattern isreally closed.Our performance study shows that in most cases, TFPoutperforms CLOSET and CHARM, two efficient frequentclosed pattern mining algorithms, even when both are running with the best tuned min_support. Furthermore, themethod can be extended to generate association rules andto incorporate user-specified constraints. Thus we concludethat for frequent pattern mining, mining top-k frequent closedpatterns without min support is more preferable than thetraditional min_support-based mining."
65,"Frequent pattern mining has been studied extensively.However, the effectiveness and efficiency of this mining isoften limited, since the number of frequent patterns generatedis often too large. In many applications it is sufficientto generate and examine only frequent patterns with supportfrequency in close-enough approximation instead of in fullprecision. Such a compact but close-enough frequent patternbase is called a condensed frequent patterns-base.In this paper, we propose and examine several alternativesat the design, representation, and implementation ofsuch condensed frequent pattern-bases. A few algorithmsfor computing such pattern-bases are proposed. Their effectivenessat pattern compression and their efficient computationmethods are investigated. A systematic performancestudy is conducted on different kinds of databases,which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of ourapproach at handling frequent pattern mining in largedatabases."
66,"Constraints are essential for many sequential pattern mining applications. However, there is no systematic study on constraint-based sequential pattern mining. In this paper, we investigate this issue and point out that the framework developed for constrained frequent-pattern mining does not fit our missions well. An extended framework is developed based on a sequential pattern growth methodology. Our study shows that constraints can be effectively and efficiently pushed deep into sequential pattern mining under this new framework. Moreover, this framework can be extended to constraint-based structured pattern mining as well."
67,"Searching, comprehending, and using the semistructured HTML, XML, and database-service-engineinformation stored on the Web poses a significant challenge: This data is more sophisticated and dynamic than the information commercial database systems store. To supplement keywordbased indexing, researchers have applied data mining to Webpage ranking. In this context, data mining helps Web search engines find high-quality Web pages and enhances Web click stream analysis. For the Web to reach its full potential, however, we must improve its services, make it more comprehensible, and increase its usability. As researchers continue to develop data mining techniques, the authors believe this technology will play an increasingly important role in meeting the challenges of developing the intelligent Web.Ultimately, data mining for Web intelligence will make the Web a richer, friendlier, and more intelligent resource that we can all share and explore."
68,"Multidimensional inter-transactional association rules extend the traditional association rules to describe more general associations among items with multiple properties across transactions. “After McDonald and Burger King open branches, KFC will open a branch two months later and one mile away” is an example of such rules. Since the number of potential inter-transactional association rules tends to be extremely large, mining inter-transactional associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining traditional intra-transactional associations. In order to make such association rule mining truly practical and computationally tractable, in this study we present a template model to help users declare the interesting multidimensional inter-transactional associations to be mined. With the guidance of templates, several optimization techniques, i.e., joining, converging, and speeding, are devised to speed up the discovery of inter-transactional association rules. We show, through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real-life data sets, that these optimization techniques can yield significant performance benefits."
69,"Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristics that may exist implicitly in spatial databases. To this end, this paper has three main contributions. First, we propose a new clustering method called CLARANS, whose aim is to identify spatial structures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, we investigate how CLARANS can handle not only points objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, we develop two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with existing spatial data mining algorithms."
70,"Partitioning a data cube into sets of cells with "similar behavior" often better exposes the semantics in the cube. E.g., if we find that average boots sales in the West 10th store of Walmart was the same for winter as for the whole year, it signifies something interesting about the trend of boots sales in that location in that year. In this paper, we are interested in finding succinct summaries of the data cube, exploiting regularities present in the cube, with a clear basis. We would like the summary: (i) to be as concise as possible, (ii) to itself form a lattice preserving the rollup/drilldown semantics of the cube, and (iii) to allow the original cube to be fully recovered. We illustrate the utility of solving this problem and discuss the inherent challenges. We develop techniques for partitioning cube cells for obtaining succinct summaries, and introduce the quotient cube. We give efficient algorithms for computing it from a base table. For monotone aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM on non-negative measures, etc.), our solution is optimal (i.e., quotient cube of the least size). For nonmonotone functions (e.g., AVG), we obtain a locally optimal solution. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our ideas and techniques and the scalability of our algorithms."

This is a challenging task."

73,"Recent progress in data mining research has led to the development of numerous efficient and scalable methods for mining interesting patterns in large databases. In the mean time, recent progress in biology, medical science, and DNA technology has led to the accumulation of tremendous amounts of bio-medical data that demands for in-depth analysis. The question becomes how to bridge the two fields, data mining and bioinformatics, for successful mining of bio-medical data. In this abstract, we analyze how data mining may help bio-medical data analysis and outline some research problems that may motivate the further developments of data mining tools for bio-data analysis."
74,"Web page classification is one of the essential techniques for Web mining. Specifically, classifying Web pages of a user-interesting class is the first step of mining interesting information from the Web. However, constructing a classifier for an interesting class requires laborious pre-processing such as collecting positive and negative training examples. For instance, in order to construct a "homepage" classifier, one needs to collect a sample of homepages (positive examples) and a sample of non-homepages (negative examples). In particular, collecting negative training examples requires arduous work and special caution to avoid biasing them. We introduce in this paper the Positive Example Based Learning (PEBL) framework for Web page classification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examples in pre-processing. We present an algorithm called Mapping-Convergence (M-C) that achieves classification accuracy (with positive and unlabeled data) as high as that of traditional SVM (with positive and negative data). Our experiments show that when the M-C algorithm uses the same amount of positive examples as that of traditional SVM, the M-C algorithm performs as well as traditional SVM."
75,"In this paper, we present a novel algorithm Opportune Project for mining complete set of frequent item sets by projecting databases to grow a frequent item set tree. Our algorithm is fundamentally different from those proposed in the past in that it opportunistically chooses between two different structures, array-based or tree-based, to represent projected transaction subsets, and heuristically decides to build unfiltered pseudo projection or to make a filtered copy according to features of the subsets. More importantly, we propose novel methods to build tree-based pseudo projections and array-based unfiltered projections for projected transaction subsets, which makes our algorithm both CPU time efficient and memory saving. Basically, the algorithm grows the frequent item set tree by depth first search, whereas breadth first search is used to build the upper portion of the tree if necessary. We test our algorithm versus several other algorithms on real world datasets, such as BMS-POS, and on IBM artificial datasets. The empirical results show that our algorithm is not only the most efficient on both sparse and dense databases at all levels of support threshold, but also highly scalable to very large databases."
76,"Data cube enables fast online analysis of large data repositories which is attractive in many applications. Although there are several kinds of available cube-based OLAP products, users may still encounter challenges on effectiveness and efficiency in the exploration of large data cubes due to the huge computation space as well as the huge observation space in a data cube. CubeExplorer is an integrated environment for online exploration of data cubes. It integrates our newly developed techniques on iceberg cube computation [2], cube-based feature extraction, and gradient analysis [1], and makes cube exploration effective and efficient. In this demo, we will show the features of CubeExplorer, especially its power and flexibility at exploring and mining of large databases."
77,"Pattern discovery in long sequences is of great importance in many applications including computational biology study, consumer behavior analysis, system performance analysis, etc. In a noisy environment, an observed sequence may not accurately reflect the underlying behavior. For example, in a protein sequence, the amino acid N is likely to mutate to D with little impact to the biological function of the protein. It would be desirable if the occurrence of D in the observation can be related to a possible mutation from N in an appropriate manner. Unfortunately, the support measure (i.e., the number of occurrences) of a pattern does not serve this purpose. In this paper, we introduce the concept of compatibility matrix as the means to provide a probabilistic connection from the observation to the underlying true value. A new metric match is also proposed to capture the "real support" of a pattern which would be expected if a noise-free environment is assumed. In addition, in the context we address, a pattern could be very long. The standard pruning technique developed for the market basket problem may not work efficiently. As a result, a novel algorithm that combines statistical sampling and a new technique (namely border collapsing) is devised to discover long patterns in a minimal number of scans of the sequence database with sufficiently high confidence. Empirical results demonstrate the robustness of the match model (with respect to the noise) and the efficiency of the probabilistic algorithm."
78,"It has been well recognized that frequent pattern mining plays an essential role in many important data mining tasks. However, frequent pattern mining often generates a very large number of patterns and rules, which reduces not only the efficiency but also the effectiveness of mining. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-based mining paradigm in the context of mining frequent itemsets, associations, correlations, sequential patterns, and many other interesting patterns in large databases.Recently, we developed efficient pattern-growth methods for frequent pattern mining. Interestingly, pattern-growth methods are not only efficient but also effective in mining with various constraints. Many tough constraints which cannot be handled by previous methods can be pushed deep into the pattern-growth mining process. In this paper, we overview the principles of pattern-growth methods for constrained frequent pattern mining and sequential pattern mining. Moreover, we explore the power of pattern-growth methods towards mining with tough constraints and highlight some interesting open problems."
79,"In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, called TD-FP-Growth (the shorthand for Top-Down FP-Growth), to mine frequent patterns. TD-FP-Growth searches the FP-tree in the top-down order, as opposed to the bottom-up order of previously proposed FP-Growth. The advantage of the topdown search is not generating conditional pattern bases and sub-FP-trees, thus, saving substantial amount of time and space. We extend TD-FP-Growth to mine association rules by applying two new pruning strategies: one is to push multiple minimum supports and the other is to push the minimum confidence. Experiments show that these algorithms and strategies are highly effective in reducing the search space."
80,"A major obstacle in data mining applications is the gap between the statistic-based pattern extraction and the value-based decision making. We present a profit mining approach to reduce this gap. In profit mining, we are given a set of past transactions and pre-selected target items, and we like to build a model for recommending target items and promotion strategies to new customers, with the goal of maximizing the net profit. We identify several issues in profit mining and propose solutions. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach using data sets of a wide range of characteristics."
81,"DBMiner is an online analytical mining system, developed for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge in large relational databases and data warehouses (see Chapters 6.1 and 13). The distinct feature of the system is its tight integration of online analytical processing (OLAP) with a wide spectrum of data mining functions, including characterization, association, classification, prediction, and clustering (see Chapters 16.1, 16.2.2, 16.2.3 and 16.5). The system facilitates query-based, interactive mining of multidimensional databases (see Chapter 6.3) by implementing a set of advanced data mining techniques, including OLAP-based induction, multidimensional statistical analysis, progressive deepening for mining refined knowledge, meta-rule guided mining, and data and knowledge visualization (see Chapter 20). DBMiner integrates smoothly with commercial relational database and data warehouse systems, and provides a user-friendly, interactive data mining environment with high performance. With extensions to the DBMiner system, several specialized data mining system prototypes, including GeoMiner, MultiMediaMiner, and WeblogMiner, have been designed and developed for mining complex types of data with interesting applications."
82,"Descriptive data mining is the description of a set of data in a concise and summary manner and the presentation of the general properties of the data. Mining characteristic rules and discriminant rules from the data are two essential components in descriptive data mining. In contrast to online analytical processing, data description puts more emphasis on (1) automated processing, helping users determine which dimensions (or attributes) should be included in the analysis and to what abstraction level the data set should be generalized in order to obtain interesting summarization; and (2) handling complex data types. Mining data characteristics and discriminant descriptions can be implemented based on a data cube method or an attribute-oriented induction method. Moreover, data description can be enhanced by data dispersion analysis, multifeature data cubes, and discovery-driven data cubes."
83,"Methods for efficient mining of frequent patterns have been studied extensively by many researchers. However, the previously proposed methods still encounter someperformance bottlenecks when mining databases with different data characteristics, such as dense vs. sparse, long vs. short patterns, memory-based vs. disk-based, etc.In this study, we propose a simple and novel hyper-linkeddata structure, H-struct , and a new mining algorithm, H-mine ,which takes advantage of this data structure anddynamically adjusts links in the mining process. A distinct feature of this method is that it has very limitedand precisely predictable space overhead and runs really fast in memory-based setting. Moreover, it ca be scaled up to very large databases by database partitioning, and whenthe data set becomes dense,(conditional)FP-trees can be constructed dynamically as part of the mining process. Our study shows that H-mine has high performance in various kinds of data, outperforms the previously developedalgorithms in different settings, and is highly scalable in mining large databases. This study also proposes a new datamining methodology, space-preserving mining ,which mayhave strong impact in the future development of efficient and scalable data mining methods."
84,"Previous studies propose that associative classification has high classification accuracy and strong flexibility at handling unstructured data. However, it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classificationis based on only single high-confidence rule. In this study, we propose new associative classification method, CMAR, i.e., Classification based on Multiple Association Rules. The method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, FP-growth ,constructs classdistribution-associated FP-tree, and mines large database efficiently. Moreover, it applies CR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rulesefficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. The classification is performed based on weighted X2 analysis using multiple strong association rules. Our extensive experiments on 26 databases from UCI machine learning database repository show that CMAR is consistent, highly effective at classificationof various kinds of databases and has better average classificationaccuracy in comparison with CBA and C4.5.Moreover,our performancestudy shows that the method is highly efficient and scalable in comparison with other reported associative classification methods."
85,"Sequential pattern mining, which finds the set of frequent subsequences in sequence databases, is an important data-mining task and has broad applications. Usually, sequence patterns are associated with different circumstances, and such circumstances form a multiple dimensional space. For example, customer purchase sequences are associated with region, time, customer group, and others. It is interesting and useful to mine sequential patterns associated with multi-dimensional information.In this paper, we propose the theme of multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining, which integrates the multidimensional analysis and sequential data mining. We also thoroughly explore efficient methods for multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining. We examine feasible combinations of efficient sequential pattern mining and multi-dimensional analysis methods, as well as develop uniform methods for high-performance mining. Extensive experiments show the advantages as well as limitations of these methods. Some recommendations on selecting proper method with respect to data set properties are drawn."
86,"Many people rely on the recommendations of trusted friends to find restaurants or movies, which match their tastes. But, what if your friends have not sampled the item of interest? Collaborative filtering (CF) seeks to increase the effectiveness of this process by automating the derivation of a recommendation, often from a clique of advisors that we have no prior personal relationship with. CF is a promising tool for dealing with the information overload that we face in the networked world."
87,"Outlier detection is an important task in data mining with numerous applications, including credit card fraud detection, video surveillance, etc. A recent work on outlier detection has introduced a novel notion of local outlier in which the degree to which an object is outlying is dependent on the density of its local neighborhood, and each object can be assigned a Local Outlier Factor (LOF) which represents the likelihood of that object being an outlier. Although the concept of local outliers is a useful one, the computation of LOF values for every data objects requires a large number of κ-nearest neighbors searches and can be computationally expensive. Since most objects are usually not outliers, it is useful to provide users with the option of finding only n most outstanding local outliers, i.e., the top-n data objects which are most likely to be local outliers according to their LOFs. However, if the pruning is not done carefully, finding top-n outliers could result in the same amount of computation as finding LOF for all objects. In this paper, we propose a novel method to efficiently find the top-n local outliers in large databases. The concept of "micro-cluster" is introduced to compress the data. An efficient micro-cluster-based local outlier mining algorithm is designed based on this concept. As our algorithm can be adversely affected by the overlapping in the micro-clusters, we proposed a meaningful cut-plane solution for overlapping data. The formal analysis and experiments show that this method can achieve good performance in finding the most outstanding local outliers."
88,"It is often too expensive to compute and materialize a complete high-dimensional data cube. Computing an iceberg cube, which contains only aggregates above certain thresholds, is an effective way to derive nontrivial multi-dimensional aggregations for OLAP and data mining."
89,"Constrained clustering--finding clusters that satisfy user-specified constraints--is highly desirable in many applications. In this paper, we introduce the constrained clustering problem and show that traditional clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) cannot handle it. A scalable constraint-clustering algorithm is developed in this study which starts by finding an initial solution that satisfies user-specified constraints and then refines the solution by performing confined object movements under constraints. Our algorithm consists of two phases: pivot movement and deadlock resolution. For both phases, we show that finding the optimal solution is NP-hard. We then propose several heuristics and show how our algorithm can scale up for large data sets using the heuristic of micro-cluster sharing. By experiments, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristics."
90,"With a huge amount of data stored in spatial databases and the introduction of spatial components to many relational or object-relational databases, it is important to study the methods for spatial data warehousing and OLAP of spatial data. In this paper, we study methods for spatial OLAP, by integration of nonspatial OLAP methods with spatial database implementation techniques. A spatial data warehouse model, which consists of both spatial and nonspatial dimensions and measures, is proposed. Methods for computation of spatial data cubes and analytical processing on such spatial data cubes are studied, with several strategies proposed, including approximation and selective materialization of the spatial objects resulted from spatial OLAP operations. The focus of our study is on a method for spatial cube construction, called object-based selective materialization, which is different from cuboid-based selective materialization proposed in previous studies of nonspatial data cube construction. Rather than using a cuboid as an atomic structure during the selective materialization, we explore granularity on a much finer level, that of a single cell of a cuboid. Several algorithms are proposed for object-based selective materialization of spatial data cubes and the performance study has demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques."
91,"In this paper, we extend the scope of mining association rules from traditional single-dimensional intratransaction associations, to multidimensional intertransaction associations. Intratransaction associations are the associations among items with the same transaction, where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer, the events happened on the same day, and so on. However, an intertransaction association describes the association relationships among different transactions, such as “if(company) A's stock goes up on day 1, B's stock will go down on day 2, but go up on day 4.” In this case, whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction, the associated items belong to different transactions. Moreover, such an intertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple contextual properties in the same rule, so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can be defined and discovered. A two-dimensional intertransaction association rule example is “After McDonald and Burger King open branches, KFC will open a branch two months later and one mile away,” which involves two dimensions: time and space. Mining intertransaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining intratransaction associations. Interestingly, intratransaction association can be treated as a special case of intertransaction association from both a conceptual and algorithmic point of view. In this study, we introduce the notion of multidimensional intertransaction association rules, study their measurements—support and confidence—and develop algorithms for mining intertransaction associations by extension of Apriori. We overview our experience using the algorithms on both real-life and synthetic data sets. Further extensions of multidimensional intertransaction association rules and potential applications are also discussed."
92,"Time-series data mining presents many challenges due to the intrinsic large scale and high dimensionality of the data sets. Subsequence similarity matching has been an active research area driven by the need to analyse large data sets in the financial, biomedical and scientific databases. In this paper, we investigate an intelligent subsequence similarity matching of time series queries based on efficient graph traversal. We introduce a new problem, the approximate partial matching of a query sequence in a time series database. Our system can address such queries with high specificity and minimal time and space overhead. The performance bottleneck of the current methods were analysed and we show our method can improve the performance of the time series queries significantly. It is general and flexible enough to find the best approximate match query without specifying a tolerance Ɛ parameter."
93,"Data mining has become an important technique which has tremendous potential in many commercial and industrial applications. Attribute-oriented induction is a powerful mining technique and has been successfully implemented in the data mining system DBMiner (Han et al. Proc. 1996 Int'l Conf. on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (KDD'96), Portland, Oregon, 1996). However, its induction capability is limited by the unconditional concept generalization. In this paper, we extend the concept generalization to rule-based concept hierarchy, which enhances greatly its induction power. When previously proposed induction algorithm is applied to the more general rule-based case, a problem of induction anomaly occurs which impacts its efficiency. We have developed an efficient algorithm to facilitate induction on the rule-based case which can avoid the anomaly. Performance studies have shown that the algorithm is superior than a previously proposed algorithm based on backtracking."
94,"Capturing application semantics and allowing a human analyst to express his focus in mining have been the motivation for several recent studies on constrained mining. In this paper, we introduce and study the problem of constrained clustering—finding clusters that satisfy certain user-specified constraints. We argue that this problem arises naturally in practice. Two types of constraints are discussed in this paper. The first type of constraints are imposed by physical obstacles that exist in the region of clustering. The second type of constraints are SQL constraints which every cluster must satisfy. We provide a prelimary introduction to both types of constraints and discuss some techniques for solving them."
95,"Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, time-series databases, and many other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist prolific patterns and/or long patterns."
96,"With the explosive growth of data available on the World Wide Web, discovery and analysis of useful information from the World Wide Web becomes a practical necessity. Web access pattern, which is the sequence of accesses pursued by users frequently, is a kind of interesting and useful knowledge in practice."
97,"Clustering analysis has been a very active area of research in the data mining community. However, most algorithms have ignored the fact that physical obstacles exist in the real world and could thus affect the result of clustering dramatically. In this paper, we will look at the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles. We called this problem the COE (Clustering with Obstacles Entities) problem and provide an outline of an algorithm called COE-CLARANS to solve it."
98,"On 18--20 March 1999, a Specialist Meeting on "Discovering geographic knowledge in data-rich environments" was convened under the auspices of the Varenius Project of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA). This, workshop brought together a diverse group of researchers and practitioners with interests in developing and applying new techniques for exploring large and diverse geographic datasets. The interaction prior to, during and after the three-day workshop resulted in the identification of research priorities and directions for continued development of "geographic knowledge discovery" (GKD) theory techniques."
