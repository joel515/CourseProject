99,"Multi-dimensional, inter-transaction association rules extend the traditional association rules to describe more general associations among items with multiple properties cross transactions. “After McDonald and Burger King open branches, KFC will open a branch two months later and one mile away” is an example of such rules. Since the number of potential inter-transaction association rules tends to be extremely large, mining inter-transaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining intra-transaction associations. In order to make such association mining truly practical and computationally tractable, in this study, we present a template model to help users declare the interesting inter-transaction associations to be mined. With the guidance of templates, several optimization techniques are devised to speed up the discovery of inter-transaction association rules. We show, through a series of experiments, that these optimization techniques can yield significant performance benefits."
100,"A top-down progressive deepening method is developed for efficient mining of multiple-level association rules from large transaction databases based on the Apriori principle. A group of variant algorithms is proposed based on the ways of sharing intermediate results, with the relative performance tested and analyzed. The enforcement of different interestingness measurements to find more interesting rules, and the relaxation of rule conditions for finding level-crossing association rules, are also investigated in the paper. Our study shows that efficient algorithms can be developed from large databases for the discovery of interesting and strong multiple-level association rules."
101,"Although many data-mining methodologies and systems have been developed in recent years, the authors contend that by and large, present mining models lack human involvement, particularly in the form of guidance and user control. They believe that data mining is most effective when the computer does what it does best--like searching large databases or counting--and users do what they do best, like specifying the current mining session's focus. This division of labor is best achieved through constraint-based mining, in which the user provides restraints that guide a search. Mining can also be improved by employing a multidimensional, hierarchical view of the data. Current data warehouse systems have provided a fertile ground for systematic development of this multidimensional mining. Together, constraint-based and multidimensional techniques can provide a more ad hoc, query-driven process that effectively exploits the semantics of data than those supported by current stand-alone data-mining systems."
102,"The polygon amalgamation operation computes the boundary of the union of a set of polygons. This is an important operation for spatial on-line analytical processing and spatial data mining, where polygons representing different spatial objects often need to be amalgamated by varying criteria when the user wants to aggregate or reclassify these objects. The processing cost of this operation can be very high for a large number of polygons. Based on the observation that not all polygons to be amalgamated contribute to the boundary, we investigate in this paper efficient polygon amalgamation methods by excluding those internal polygons without retrieving them from the database. Two novel algorithms, adjacency-based and occupancy-based, are proposed. While both algorithms can reduce the amalgamation cost significantly, the occupancy-based algorithm is particularly attractive because: 1) it retrieves a smaller amount of data than the adjacency-based algorithm; 2) it is based on a simple extension to a commonly used spatial indexing mechanism; and 3) it can handle fuzzy amalgamation."
103,"Although there have been many studies on data mining, to date there have been few research prototypes or commercial systems supporting comprehensive query-driven mining, which encourages interactive exploration of the data. Our thesis is that constraint constructs and the optimization they induce play a pivotal role in mining queries, thus substantially enhancing the usefulness and performance of the mining system. This is based on the analogy of declarative query languages like SQL and query optimization which have made relational databases so successful. To this end, our proposed demo is not yet another data mining system, but of a new paradigm in data mining - mining with constraints, as the important first step towards supporting ad-hoc mining in DBMS."
104,"Currently, there is tremendous interest in providing ad-hoc mining capabilities in database management systems. As a first step towards this goal, in [15] we proposed an architecture for supporting constraint-based, human-centered, exploratory mining of various kinds of rules including associations, introduced the notion of constrained frequent set queries (CFQs), and developed effective pruning optimizations for CFQs with 1-variable (1-var) constraints."
105,"A novel indexing structure join index hierarchy is proposed to handle the "gotos on disk" problem in object-oriented query processing. The method constructs a hierarchy of join indices and transforms a sequence of pointer chasing operations into a simple search in an appropriate join index file, and thus accelerates navigation in object-oriented databases. The method extends the join index structure studied in relational and spatial databases, supports both forward and backward navigations among objects and classes, and localizes update propagations in the hierarchy. Our performance study shows that partial join index hierarchy outperforms several other indexing mechanisms in object-oriented query processing."
106,"Data Mining is a young but flourishing field. Many algorithms and applications exist to mine different types of data and extract different types of knowledge. Mining multimedia data is, however, at an experimental stage.We have implemented a prototype for mining high-level multimedia information and knowledge from large multimedia databases. MultiMedia Miner has been designed based on our years of experience in the research and development of a relational data mining system, DBMiner, in the Intelligent Database Systems Research Laboratory, and a Content-Based Image Retrieval system from Digital Libraries, C-BIRD, in the Vision and Media Laboratory.MultiMediaMiner includes the construction of multimedia data cubes which facilitate multiple dimensional analysis of multimedia data, and the mining of multiple kinds of knowledge, including summarization, classification, and association, in image and video databases. The images and video clips used in our experiments are collected by crawling the WWW. Many challenges have yet to be overcome, such as the large number of dimensions, and the existence of multi-valued dimensions."
107,"Periodicity search, that is, search for cyclicity in time-related databases, is an interesting data mining problem. Most previous studies have been on finding full-cycle periodicity for all the segments in the selected sequences of the data, that is, if a sequence is periodic, all the points or segments in the period repeat. However, it is often useful to mine segment-wise or point-wise periodicity in time-related data sets. In this study, we integrate data cube and Apriori data mining techniques for mining segment-wise periodicity in regard to a fixed length period and show that data cube provides an efficient structure and a convenient way for interactive mining of multiple-level periodicity."
108,"From the standpoint of supporting human-centered discovery of knowledge, the present-day model of mining association rules suffers from the following serious shortcomings: (i) lack of user exploration and control, (ii) lack of focus, and (iii) rigid notion of relationships. In effect, this model functions as a black-box, admitting little user interaction in between. We propose, in this paper, an architecture that opens up the black-box, and supports constraint-based, human-centered exploratory mining of associations. The foundation of this architecture is a rich set of constraint constructs, including domain, class, and SQL-style aggregate constraints, which enable users to clearly specify what associations are to be mined. We propose constrained association queries as a means of specifying the constraints to be satisfied by the antecedent and consequent of a mined association."
109,"Multimedia data mining is the mining of high-level multimedia information and knowledge from large multimedia databases. A multimedia data mining system prototype, MultiMediaMiner, has been designed and developed. It includes the construction of a multimedia data cube which facilitates multiple dimensional analysis of multimedia data, primarily based on visual content, and the mining of multiple kinds of knowledge, including summarization, comparison, classification, association, and clustering."
110,"As a confluence of data mining and WWW technologies, it is now possible to perform data mining on web log records collected from the Internet web page access history. The behaviour of the web page readers is imprinted in the web server log files. Analyzing and exploring regularities in this behaviour can improve system performance, enhance the quality and delivery of Internet information services to the end user, and identify population of potential customers for electronic commerce. Thus, by observing people using collections of data, data mining can bring considerable contribution to digital library designers. In a joint effort between the TeleLearning-NCE project on Virtual University and NCE-IRIS project on data mining, we have been developing the knowledge discovery tool, WebLogMiner, for mining web server log files. This paper presents the design of the WebLogMiner, reports the current progress, and outlines the future work in this direction."
111,"Great efforts have been paid in the Intelligent Database Systems Research Lab for the research and development of efficient data mining methods and construction of on-line analytical data mining systems.Our work has been focused on the integration of data mining and OLAP technologies and the development of scalable, integrated, and multiple data mining functions. A data mining system, DBMiner, has been developed for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge in large relational databases and data warehouses. The system implements a wide spectrum of data mining functions, including characterization, comparison, association, classification, prediction, and clustering. It also builds up a user-friendly, interactive data mining environment and a set of knowledge visualization tools. In-depth research has been performed on the efficiency and scalability of data mining methods. Moreover, the research has been extended to spatial data mining, multimedia data mining, text mining, and Web mining with several new data mining system prototypes constructed or under construction, including GeoMiner, MultiMediaMiner, and WebLogMiner.This article summarizes our research and development activities in the last several years and shares our experiences and lessons with the readers."

113,"In this paper, we employ a novel approach to metarule-guided, multi-dimensional association rule mining which explores a data cube structure. We propose algorithms for metarule-guided mining: given a metarule containing p predicates, we compare mining on an n-dimensional (n-D) cube structure (where p < n) with mining on smaller multiple p-dimensional cubes. In addition, we propose an efficient method for precomputing the cube, which takes into account the constraints imposed by the given metarule."
114,"Efficiency and scalability are fundamental issues concerning data mining in large databases. Although classification has been studied extensively, few of the known methods take serious consideration of efficient induction in large databases and the analysis of data at multiple abstraction levels. The paper addresses the efficiency and scalability issues by proposing a data classification method which integrates attribute oriented induction, relevance analysis, and the induction of decision trees. Such an integration leads to efficient, high quality, multiple level classification of large amounts of data, the relaxation of the requirement of perfect training sets, and the elegant handling of continuous and noisy data."
115,"With the existence of many large transaction databases, the huge   amounts of data, the high scability of distributed systems, and the easy partition and distribution of a centralized database, it is important to investigate efficient methods for distributed mining of association rules. This study discloses some interesting relationships between locally large and globally large itemsets and proposes an interesting distributed association rule mining algorithm, FDM (Fast Distributed Mining of association rules), which generates a small number of candidate sets and substantially reduces the number of messages to be passed at mining association rules. Our performance study shows that FDM has a superior performance over the direct application of a typical sequential algorithm. Further  performance enhancement leads to a few variations of the algorithm."
116,"Mining information and knowledge from large databases has been recognized by many researchers as a key research topic in database systems and machine learning, and by many industrial companies as an important area with an opportunity of major revenues. Researchers in many different fields have shown great interest in data mining. Several emerging applications in information providing services, such as data warehousing and on-line services over the Internet, also call for various data mining techniques to better understand user behavior, to improve the service provided, and to increase the business opportunities. In response to such a demand, this article is to provide a survey, from a database researcher's point of view, on the data mining techniques developed recently. A classification of the available data mining techniques is provided, and a comparative study of such techniques is presented."
117,"In object-oriented database systems where the concept of the superclass-subclass is supported, an instance of a subclass is also an instance of its superclass. Consequently, the access scope of a query against a class in general includes the access scope of all its subclasses, unless specified otherwise. An index to support superclass-subclass relationship efficiently must provide efficient associative retrievals of objects from a single class or from several classes in a class hierarchy. This paper presents an efficient index called the hierarchical tree (the H-tree). For each class, an H-tree is maintained, allowing efficient search on a single class. These H-trees are appropriately linked to capture the superclass-subclass relationships, thus allowing efficient retrievals of instances from a class hierarchy. Both experimental and analytical results indicate that the H-tree is an efficient indexing structure."
118,"A data mining system, DBMiner, has been developed for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge in large relational databases. The system implements a wide spectrum of data mining functions, including generalization, characterization, association, classification, and prediction. By incorporating several interesting data mining techniques, including attribute-oriented induction, statistical analysis, progressive deepening for mining multiple-level knowledge, and meta-rule guided mining, the system provides a user-friendly, interactive data mining environment with good performance."
119,"Knowledge discovery facilitates querying database knowledge and intelligent query answering in database systems. In this paper, we investigate the application of discovered knowledge, concept hierarchies, and knowledge discovery tools for intelligent query answering in database systems. A knowledge-rich data model is constructed to incorporate discovered knowledge and knowledge discovery tools. Queries are classified into data queries and knowledge queries. Both types of queries can be answered directly by simple retrieval or intelligently by analyzing the intent of query and providing generalized, neighborhood or associated information using stored or discovered knowledge. Techniques have been developed for intelligent query answering using discovered knowledge and/or knowledge discovery tools, which includes generalization, data summarization, concept clustering, rule discovery, query rewriting, deduction, lazy evaluation, application of multiple-layered databases, etc. Our study shows that knowledge discovery substantially broadens the spectrum of intelligent query answering and may have deep implications on query answering in data- and knowledge-base systems."
120,"Data mining, or knowledge discovery in databases, has been popularly recognized as an important research issue with broad applications. We provide a comprehensive survey, in database perspective, on the data mining techniques developed recently. Several major kinds of data mining methods, including generalization, characterization, classification, clustering, association, evolution, pattern matching, data visualization, and meta-rule guided mining, will be reviewed. Techniques for mining knowledge in different kinds of databases, including relational, transaction, object-oriented, spatial, and active databases, as well as global information systems, will be examined. Potential data mining applications and some research issues will also be discussed."
121,"An incremental updating technique is developed for maintenance of the association rules discovered by database mining. There have been many studies on efficient discovery of association rules in large databases. However, it is nontrivial to maintain such discovered rules in large databases because a database may allow frequent or occasional updates and such updates may not only invalidate some existing strong association rules but also turn some weak rules into strong ones. In this study, an incremental updating technique is proposed for efficient maintenance of discovered association rules when new transaction data are added to a transaction database."
122,"Efficient and effective discovery of resource and knowledge from the Internet has become an imminent research issue, especially with the advent of the Information Super-Highway. A multiple layered database (MLDB) approach is proposed to handle the resource and knowledge discovery in global information base. A preliminary experiment shows the advantages of such an approach. Information retrieval, data mining, and data analysis techniques can be used to extract and transform information from a lower layer database to a higher one. Resources can be found by controlled search through different layers of the database, and knowledge discovery can be performed efficiently in such a layered database."
123,"A prototyped data mining system, DBLearn, was developed in Simon Fraser Univ., which integrates machine learning methodologies with database technologies and efficiently and effectively extracts characteristic and discriminant rules from relational databases. Further developments, of DBLearn lead to a new generation data mining system: DBMiner, with the following features: (1) mining new kinds of rules from large databases, including multiple-level association rules, classification rules, cluster description rules, etc., (2) automatic generation and refinement of concept hierarchies, (3) high level SQL-like and graphical data mining interfaces, and (4) client/server architecture and performance improvements for large applications. The major features of the system are demonstrated with experiments in a research grant information database."
124,"Many popularly studied recursions in deductive databases can be compiled into one or a set of highly regular chain generating paths, each of which consists of one or a set of connected predicates. Previous studies on chain-based query evaluation in deductive databases take a chain generating path as an inseparable unit in the evaluation. However, some recursions, especially many functional recursions whose compiled chain consists of infinitely evaluable function(s), should be evaluated by chain-split evaluation, which splits a chain generating path into two portions in the evaluation: an immediately evaluable portion and a delayed-evaluation portion. In this paper, the necessity of chain-split evaluation is examined from the points of view of both efficiency and finite evaluation, and three chain-split evaluation techniques: magic sets, buffered evaluation, and partial evaluation are developed. Our study shows that chain-split evaluation is a primitive recursive query evaluation technique for different kinds of recursions, and it can be implemented efficiently in deductive databases by extensions to the existing recursive query evaluation methods."
125,"A deductive database system prototype, LogicBase, has been developed, with an emphasis on efficient compilation and query evaluation of application-oriented recursions in deductive databases. The system identifies different classes of recursions and compiles recursions into chain or psuedo-chain forms when appropriate. Queries posed to the compiled recursions are analyzed systematically with efficient evaluation plans generated and executed, mainly based on a chained-based query evaluation method. The system has been tested using sophisticated recursions and queries with satisfactory performance. This paper introduces the general design principles and implementation techniques of the system and discusses its strength and limitations."
126,"We study a general class of single linear recursions and the properties of their expansions by analyzing the structures of the recursions. We show that the expansions of a linear recursion of this class are very regular in that the variable connections are heavily shared and change periodically with respect to the expansions. The variable connections can be precisely characterized as static bindings and chain connections. We conclude that a single linear recursion under our assumptions either is bounded or can be expressed as chain recursions. This study contributes to query processing, because it provides the basis for rule compilation as a general and powerful technique for query processing. Combined with query information, the expansion properties of the recursion provide optimized query-processing plans."
127,"Concept hierarchies organize data and concepts in hierarchical forms or in certain partial order, which helps expressing knowledge and data relationships in databases in concise, high level terms, and thus, plays an important role in knowledge discovery processes. Concept hierarchies could be provided by knowledge engineers, domain experts or users, or embedded in some data relations. However, it is sometimes desirable to automatically generate some concept hierarchies or adjust some given hierarchies for particular learning tasks. In this paper, the issues of dynamic generation and refinement of concept hierarchies are studied. The study leads to some algorithms for automatic generation of concept hierarchies for numerical attributes based on data distributions and for dynamic refinement of a given or generated concept hierarchy based on a learning request, the relevant set of data and database statistics. These algorithms have been implemented in the DBLearn knowledge discovery system and tested against large relational databases. The experimental results show that the algorithms are efficient and effective for knowledge discovery in large databases."
128,"A prototyped data mining system, DBLearn, has been developed, which efficiently and effectively extracts different kinds of knowledge rules from relational databases. It has the following features: high level learning interfaces, tightly integrated with commercial relational database systems, automatic refinement of concept hierarchies, efficient discovery algorithms and good performance. Substantial extensions of its knowledge discovery power towards knowledge mining in object-oriented, deductive and spatial databases are under research and development."
129,"Constraints play an important role in the efficient query evaluation in deductive databases. Constraint-based query evaluation in deductive databases is investigated, with emphasis on linear recursions with function symbols. Constraints are grouped into three classes: rule constraints, integrity constraints, and query constraints. Techniques are developed for the maximal use of different kinds of constraints in rule compilation and query evaluation. The study on the roles of different classes of constraints in set-oriented evaluation of linear recursions shows the following: rule constraints should be integrated with their corresponding deduction rules in the compilation of recursions; integrity constraints, including finiteness constraints and monotonicity constraints, should be used in the analysis of finite evaluability and termination for specific queries; and query constraints, which are often useful in search space reduction and termination, should be transformed, when necessary, and should be pushed into the compiled chains as deeply as possible for efficient evaluation. The constraint-based query-processing technique integrates query-independent compilation and chain-based query evaluation methods and demonstrates its great promise in deductive query evaluation."
130,"Object-oriented database system has become increasingly popular and influential in the development of new generation database systems. This motivates the investigation of mechanisms for data mining in object-oriented databases. In this paper, we propose our first step towards knowledge discovery in object-oriented databases by extension of the attribute-oriented induction technique from relational databases to object-oriented databases. By the development of sophisticated generalization operators and generalization control mechanisms, attribute-oriented induction method can be successfully extended to knowledge discovery in object-oriented databases. Furthermore, we show that knowledge discovery will substantially enhance the power and flexibility of querying data and knowledge in object-oriented databases."
131,"A quantitative rule is a rule associated with quantitative information which assesses the representativeness of the rule in the database. An efficient induction method is developed for learning quantitative rules in relational databases. With the assistance of knowledge about concept hierarchies, data relevance, and expected rule forms, attribute-oriented induction can be performed on the database, which integrates database operations with the learning process and provides a simple, efficient way of learning quantitative rules from large databases. The method involves the learning of both characteristic rules and classification rules. Quantitative information facilitates quantitative reasoning, incremental learning, and learning in the presence of noise. Moreover, learning qualitative rules can be treated as a special case of learning quantitative rules. It is shown that attribute-oriented induction provides an efficient and effective mechanism for learning various kinds of knowledge rules from relational databases."
132,"The authors present a graph model which is powerful in classifying and compiling linear recursive formulas in deductive databases. The graph model consists of two kinds of graphs: I-graph and resolution graph. Essential properties of a recursive formula can be extracted from its I-graph, and the compiled formula and the query evaluation plan of the recursive formulas can be determined from its resolution graph. It is demonstrated that based on the graph model all the linear recursive formulas can be classified into a taxonomy of classes and each class shares common characteristics in query compilation and query processing. The compiled formulas and the corresponding query evaluation plans can be derived based on the study of the compilation of each class."
133,"The authors study the efficient evaluation of side-coherent multiple linear recursions, which can be further classified into three types: multiple one-sided, multiple balanced k-sided, and multiple mixed k-sided. New techniques are developed by integrating the existing single-linear recursive query evaluation methods with the idea of side-relation unioned processing, which leads to a set of efficient query evaluation algorithms such as a side-relation unioned transitive closure algorithm for the processing of Type I ML recursions and a generalized side-relation unioned magic sets method for the processing of Types II and III ML recursions. The authors describe the processing of single-probe queries on side-coherent ML recursions. They outline the processing of complex queries on ML recursions."
134,"The authors study the compilation and efficient processing of asynchronous chain recursions and show that many complex function-free recursions, which may contain single or multiple linear recursive rules, nonlinear recursive rules, mutually recursive rules, and multiple-level recursions, can be compiled to asynchronous chain recursions. The study on the compilation methods, the simplification of compiled formulas, and the query-processing techniques shows that asynchronous chain recursions can be compiled to relatively simple compiled formulas and processed efficiently using transitive closure query-processing methods."
